/**
 * First paint for the one case the URL cannot resolve on its own.
 *
 * At `"/"` the local observatory and the hosted sign-in page are served from a
 * byte-identical document, so the shell that belongs there is only known once
 * `/api/v2/mode` answers.  Until then this renders the app's real chrome —
 * brand, title and an announced pending state — instead of a blank page.
 *
 * It is drawn on the civic paper ground that `civic-weather-room.css` gives
 * `html, body, #root`, so it is the same surface the observatory settles onto
 * and there is no flash between the two.  It deliberately shows no world data:
 * nothing here is a placeholder value.
 *
 * When the probe has failed for good (`error`), the same chrome stays up and
 * says so.  Mounting either shell on a guess would be worse: the local
 * observatory on a hosted origin is the wrong app, not a degraded one.
