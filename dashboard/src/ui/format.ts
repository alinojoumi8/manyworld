/**
 * THE EVENT-KIND CODE REGISTRY.
 *
 * Kinds are coded, not coloured: the channel has to scale past two hundred kinds
 * and a palette cannot. But a code system has to be DESIGNED, and the previous
 * one was not — anything it did not recognise fell through to `slice(0, 4)`, so
 * `civic_appointment_scheduled` printed CIVI, `claim_created` printed CLAI,
 * `ipo_bid_placed` printed IPOB and `model_numeric_narrative_redacted` printed
 * MODE. Those are not codes, they are corrupted labels, and nothing on the glyph
 * said so: MODE reads as the English word "mode" and CIVI is indistinguishable
 * from a genuine four-letter code like CONV or NEWS. Truncation that leaves no
 * mark is worse than truncation that does.
 *
 * Two rules replace it, and between them nothing is ever silently lossy:
 *
 *   1. EVERY KIND THE SYSTEM CAN EMIT HAS A DESIGNED CODE. The registry below is
 *      total over both vocabularies that exist: the distinct kinds committed by
 *      the reference run (read out of its event spine) and every kind literal
 *      the engine and world packages emit. Codes
 *      are hand-assigned, verified unique, and grouped by domain so related
 *      kinds share a stem and can be told apart at a glance rather than guessed:
 *      the six permit outcomes are PMAP/PMOK/PMNO/PMRF/PMTR/PMAB, the two
 *      information channels are IPUB and IEXP, the loan denials are LNDN, LNDC
 *      and LNDL. Where two kinds would have collided they are separated on
 *      purpose (`benefit_paid` BENP against `benefits_paid` BENS; `hired` HIRD
 *      against `job_offer_accepted` JOFA), never merged onto one glyph the way
 *      the old table merged three permit kinds onto PRMT.
 *
 *   2. AN UNREGISTERED KIND SAYS SO ON THE GLYPH. It is shortened to three
 *      letters and carries a trailing ellipsis — `CIV…`, never `CIVI` — so an
 *      abbreviation can never be mistaken for a code, and the coding is reported
 *      as inexact so the cell can be drawn in the quieter ink and say why on
 *      hover. A kind short enough to survive whole (`ipo`) is shown whole and
 *      reported exact, because that one is not lossy.
