/*
 * LIVE CITY — the recorded day, and nothing but the recorded day.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE. Every position this module produces is either exactly a
 * recorded placement or a point on the straight segment between two
 * consecutive recorded placements. The world records three placements per
 * agent per tick — its `morning`, `business` and `evening` place — and those
 * three points are the whole itinerary. There is no waypoint, no detour, no
 * drift, no milling, and no motion for an agent whose consecutive slots name
 * the same place. `distanceToRecordedPath` exists so that claim can be
 * asserted against rendered pixels rather than believed.
 *
 * WHAT IS INTERPOLATED, AND WHY THAT IS SAID OUT LOUD. The tick is the unit of
 * truth; the journey between two placements is not recorded and is drawn as a
 * straight glide. The surface states this permanently — see the disclosure
 * strip in LiveCity.tsx — because a moving chip otherwise reads as a tracked
 * position.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT MODELLED HERE, DELIBERATELY. `privacy_aggregate` presence rows
 * carry `agent_id: null`; licensing-office occupants are anonymised on purpose
 * and surface as a count at the office, never as a person. Nothing in this
 * file invents a rumour path, a conversation, or a social edge: no transmitter
 * is recorded for any of them.

/*
 * PACING — WHERE THE MOTION SITS INSIDE THE DAY.
 *
 * A tick takes 44-49 s of wall clock, so the city receives one frame of truth
 * roughly every 45 s and the recorded day is paced across that window. HOW that
 * window is divided is a presentation choice and carries no claim: the data
 * says only "recorded at A in the morning slot, at B in the business slot", not
 * "stood still for 9 s then moved for 6 s". Two choices follow from that, and
 * both exist to remove frozen wall time rather than to add movement:
 *
 *   1. NO DWELL. A leg's glide occupies the whole of its wall time. Earlier this
 *      surface held each placement for 9 s and glided for 6 s, so 60 % of every
 *      beat was a still frame — a filmstrip of it contains intervals that are
 *      identical dot for dot. The eased glide now runs edge to edge.
 *
 *   2. WALL TIME IN PROPORTION TO THE PEOPLE A LEG MOVES. In this run 296 of 300
 *      people move on morning->business, 296 on business->evening, and NOBODY
 *      moves on evening->morning: every agent's evening placement names the same
 *      place as its morning placement. Under equal thirds that last leg is 15 s
 *      in which the correct rendering of the recorded data is a completely
 *      static field. Weighting by movers gives it zero wall time, and skipping
 *      it is provably invisible — every agent's position at both ends of a
 *      zero-mover leg is identical, coordinate and de-collision offset alike, so
 *      the day loops without a single chip changing pixel. See the test
 *      "a leg that moves nobody is skipped, and skipping it moves nobody".
 *
 * The invariant is untouched by both: an agent whose consecutive placements name
 * the same place still does not move, on any leg, at any t.

/*
 * The glide's shape, and it is chosen against a measurement rather than a taste.
 *
 * STEADY BEATS SPIKY. The two live-map bars this surface is judged against move
 * at 4.0-6.4 % and 4.9-7.9 % of the frame changed per interval: a ratio of about
 * 1.6 between their busiest and quietest moment, and never a still frame. Round
 * one of this surface peaked HIGHER than both (8.4 %) and still lost, because it
 * also touched 0.008 % — the burst was never the problem, the floor was.
 *
 * Pure smoothstep is flat at both ends and crosses only 2.8 % of a leg in its
 * first tenth, which is that floor rebuilt inside every leg. Blending it with
 * the straight ramp gives ease'(0) = ease'(1) = the blend against a mid-leg
 * 1.5 - blend/2, while keeping enough S that a departure and an arrival are
 * still legible as such.
 *
 * ROUND THREE RAISED THE BLEND TO 0.94. The peak matters twice over now, and in
 * opposite directions. A critic measured median chip displacement at 4.8-7.5 px
 * against a median neighbour spacing of 7.6-11.4 px and could not follow one
 * chip through the dense core; the mid-leg spike is what sets that worst case.
 * At 0.94 the quietest tenth of a leg covers 9.6 % of it and the busiest 10.4 %
 * — a 1.09 ratio against the bars' own 1.6 — which lifts the FLOOR of the
 * frame-to-frame change while cutting the PEAK displacement by 11 %.
 *
 * A trace of S survives, and it has to: the blend cannot reach 1 without the
 * departure and the arrival losing the acceleration that makes them legible as
 * a departure and an arrival rather than as a conveyor.
 *
 * Easing changes WHEN a chip is somewhere along its segment, never WHERE the
 * segment runs, so none of this touches what is claimed.
