"""Context + prompt assembly (TECH-SPEC §6).

`ContextBuilder` gathers everything an agent needs to decide — persona, state,
beliefs, retrieved memories, today's news, things heard — into one structured
`context` dict. That dict is consumed two ways:
  • scripted policies read it directly (offline runs);
  • `render_prompt` turns it into the cached system prefix + a per-wakeup user
    message for real LLMs.
Both paths therefore see identical information, so switching providers can't change
what an agent knew.
