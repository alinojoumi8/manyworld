# Development and testing

[Controlled Hermes/Jev diagnostics](hermes-diagnostics.md) provide explicit read-only
CHECK, single-citizen DECIDE-ONE and guarded ADVANCE-ONE operations. Live operations
remain deferred until the execution-policy issue is resolved.

Prospective Jev domain delegation is documented in [Jev v4](jev-domains.md).
Use its provider-free profiles for development; existing worlds retain their
recorded decision and voting contracts.

Local operator household inspection is available from a selected person's
dossier. The [financial inspector contract](plans/2026-09-08-household-financial-inspector.md)
describes its committed-tick API, `operator_households.enabled` flag, identity
visibility and cash-inequality definitions. It requires current Semantics-20
position history; historical source runs are never repaired by the reader.

Saved-world operator studies use the bounded read-only checkpoint catalog and
the same explicit review, launch and recovery flow as fresh-world pilots. See
the [checkpoint study contract](plans/2026-09-07-checkpoint-studies.md#local-operator-interface)
for directory configuration, source limits and continuation semantics.
Focused coverage is in `tests/test_checkpoint_study_jobs.py`; browser coverage
and synthetic desktop/mobile review captures are in the world-workspace suite.

Policy studies from fresh and saved worlds use the v3 CLI, evidence reader and local operator workspace.
Their prospective day/phase recovery policy preserves the original shared
provider allowance across readiness checks and all model replicates. See the
[live-policy workflow](plans/2026-09-07-live-policy-studies.md#cli-workflow) for
drafting, explicit launch authorization, pause and provider-free resume validation.
`tests/test_policy_recovery.py` and `tests/test_policy_origins.py` exercise controlled
loopback HTTP, original allowance recovery and declared saved-world policy
transitions in their own required CI job. The operator advertises policy launches
only when a valid owner-configured design is available. Its default directory is
`data/policies`; override it with `operator_research.policy_root` in the server
configuration. See the [operator policy workflow](plans/2026-09-07-policy-operator-workflow.md#owner-configuration-and-request-contract)
for design limits, deliberate approval and original-allowance recovery.
`tests/test_policy_operator.py` covers provider-free review and real local
supervisors with controlled loopback HTTP in a separate required CI job.

Private v3 evidence is readable and portable through `research.policy_results`
and `research.study_bundle`. Export the current closed pause or sealed final
result with its reviewed hash; import into a new private directory. See the
[policy evidence contract](plans/2026-09-07-policy-evidence-bundles.md#cli-workflow)
for commands, ownership and accounting checks. A verified paused archive remains
pending, and an imported allowance cannot resume execution in a second namespace.
`tests/test_policy_evidence.py` covers all six fresh/saved and frozen/day/phase
paths in a separate required CI job using controlled loopback HTTP.

Saved semantics-11 Hermes worlds can opt into persistent geography, exploration,
settlement construction and resident charter votes. See [frontier geography](frontier.md)
for the backup-first upgrade and history contract.

## Repository workflow

Work on a feature branch or dedicated worktree. Preserve unrelated changes,
commit cohesive units, push the branch, and open a pull request into `main`.
The backend and committed dashboard bundle are one release unit.

Before integrating or deleting an older branch, follow
[branch lifecycle and consolidation](branch-lifecycle.md). Dirty worktrees,
open pull-request branches, and unique commits are protected until their exact
disposition is recorded and approved.

## Backend

```powershell
python -c "import sys; assert sys.version_info[:2] in {(3, 11), (3, 12)}, 'Python 3.11 or 3.12 required'"
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
python run.py --config runs/base.yaml
```

POSIX (bash):

```bash
python3 -c "import sys; assert sys.version_info[:2] in {(3, 11), (3, 12)}, 'Python 3.11 or 3.12 required'"
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
python run.py --config runs/base.yaml
```

Use the scripted profile for normal development. It exercises all systems
without network cost and preserves deterministic results.

`requirements.txt` is the human-edited dependency input. Regenerate the
cross-platform, hash-locked install after changing it:

```powershell
uv pip compile requirements.txt --universal --python-version 3.11 --generate-hashes -o requirements.lock
```

Research exports use DuckDB's Python type conversion path, which checks pandas
types. The pinned environment includes pandas to avoid repeated failed imports
for each value. The exporter retains its bounded SQLite row batches, independent
Parquet readback and resource limits. See the
[export measurements](plans/2026-09-09-bounded-research-exports.md#measured-optional-import-bottleneck)
for byte-parity evidence and the measured memory/time tradeoff.

The full gate also uses `uvx` for the Python dependency audit. Install
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first and verify
that it is available before running the gate:

```bash
uv --version
```

## Dashboard

Run FastAPI on port 8000, then in another terminal:

```powershell
Set-Location dashboard
npm ci
npm test
npm run licenses:check
npm run dev
```

POSIX (bash):

```bash
cd dashboard
npm ci
npm test
npm run licenses:check
npm run dev
```

Vite proxies `/api`, `/ws`, and `/reports`. The production build writes directly
to `server/static/`:

```powershell
npm --prefix dashboard run build
```

Review and commit the new hashed bundle when frontend source changes.
Run `npm run licenses` after dependency changes; Vite copies the generated
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` into the public static bundle.
The Tailwind source scan explicitly excludes `dashboard/public/` and
`dashboard/scripts/` so generated legal text and notice tooling cannot change
the application stylesheet or its content hash.

### Provider-free real-backend menu smoke

The repeatable city-to-price-study gate creates its own isolated world and serves
the production bundle: `python scripts/city_research_acceptance.py`. It covers
historical navigation, operator bookmarks, mobile keyboard selection, both price
studies, independent evidence import and unchanged source-world contents. See the
[acceptance contract](plans/2026-09-07-city-research-acceptance.md) for setup,
bounds, retained evidence and CI. Use the older manual menu smoke below when
testing a separately started disposable world.

The normal Playwright suite mocks projection contracts. To exercise the same
menus against a real deterministic database and FastAPI server, start a bounded
provider-free run in one terminal:

```powershell
python run.py --config runs/base.yaml --ticks 3 --serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Copy the printed run ID, then run the opt-in smoke from a second terminal:

```powershell
$env:AE_REAL_RUN_ID = "<run-id>"
npm --prefix dashboard run test:e2e -- e2e/world-os-real-backend.spec.ts
```

Without `AE_REAL_RUN_ID`, these opt-in tests are skipped and the mocked suite
runs normally. Complete at least one day in the disposable run first; the smoke
reads City and its panels without advancing the world. It makes no provider
calls under `runs/base.yaml` and does not validate hosted-only destinations.

To include the 3D city and test the committed production bundle directly, use
`runs/simcity.yaml` for the disposable server above and set
`$env:AE_REAL_BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"` before the browser command.
The two real-backend tests cover workspace navigation, city layers, 3D rendering,
entity evidence links, camera controls and reload. Clear `AE_REAL_BASE_URL`
before returning to the normal Vite-backed suite.

On Windows, use `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe` explicitly if another application's
Python is on PATH. A provider-free local city can be started from the repository
root with:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONUTF8 = "1"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe run.py --config runs/simcity.yaml --serve
```

Keep the server terminal running and open `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. It starts
paused; choose **Run** or **Step** to advance. No frontend development server is
needed. The evolving-live default and DeepSeek demo require their separately
documented provider setup and explicit live-inference authorization.

## Test layers

City navigation bookmarks use the separate operator store. Focused checks are
`tests/test_city_observations_api.py`, `tests/test_operator_workspace.py`, the
dashboard `cityObservations`/`cityObjectList` node suites, and the city-context and
workspace-route browser suites. These cover API admission, world immutability,
concurrent edits, mobile keyboard selection and the desktop map-area requirement.
The [navigation contract](plans/2026-09-07-city-workspace-navigation.md) records
the focused scope; the [production workflow gate](plans/2026-09-07-city-research-acceptance.md)
adds the actual backend and supervised study/export path.

Working research studies now have two explicit pause contracts: version 2 for
committed days and opt-in version 3 for saved phases. Run the bounded phase
regressions with `tests/test_phase_working_attempts.py` and
`tests/test_phase_working_studies.py`; the operator suite also covers planned
step pauses. See [paused-study recovery](plans/2026-09-06-paused-study-resume.md)
for the manifest policy, CLI controls and compatibility requirements. On Windows,
use a fresh short `--basetemp` and verify at least 40 GiB of free space before
pytest. Complete Python coverage belongs in the CI shards, not one local run.

Scripted checkpoint-derived studies use an explicit version 2 study declaration and
attempt version 4. Their independent recorded replay begins at the admitted
saved day. Run `tests/test_checkpoint_origins.py` and
`tests/test_checkpoint_studies.py` for source immutability, both price domains,
day/phase recovery, inherited-cost separation and private bundle checks. See
[saved-world studies](plans/2026-09-07-checkpoint-studies.md) for drafting and
execution commands and the remaining operator interface work.

| Layer | What it proves |
|---|---|
| Unit/invariant | Ledger conservation, markets, credit, firms, memory, metrics |
| Integration | World phases, lifecycle, providers, shocks, reports, controls, API |
| Property | Random valid actions, lifecycle storms, price and budget invariants |
| Golden | Legacy deterministic event output remains exact |
| Replay | Fresh re-execution produces canonical table equality |
| Acceptance | Rumor evidence, shock traces, Oracle samples, cost, long horizon |
| Dashboard | Client behavior and current production bundle |

Full local gate:

```powershell
python -m compileall -q agents engine experiments hosted llm oracle reports research server world run.py
python run.py --verify-datasets config/data-manifest.yaml
python -m pytest tests/ -q
python -m pip check
uvx pip-audit -r requirements.lock
npm --prefix dashboard ci
npm --prefix dashboard test
npm --prefix dashboard run licenses:check
npm --prefix dashboard audit --audit-level=high
npm --prefix dashboard run build
git diff --check
```

POSIX (bash); every gate command is shell-neutral, so these match the
ubuntu-latest CI invocations:

```bash
python -m compileall -q agents engine experiments hosted llm oracle reports research server world run.py
python run.py --verify-datasets config/data-manifest.yaml
python -m pytest tests/ -q
python -m pip check
uvx pip-audit -r requirements.lock
npm --prefix dashboard ci
npm --prefix dashboard test
npm --prefix dashboard run licenses:check
npm --prefix dashboard audit --audit-level=high
npm --prefix dashboard run build
git diff --check
```

The closure/release audit also scans the current tree and full Git history with
Gitleaks using the narrow repository config in `.gitleaks.toml`. Repeat the
dependency, notice, dataset-provenance, attribution, and secret audits before a
public tag; a successful merge audit is not a permanent publication waiver.

Commits are additionally guarded by a local pre-commit secret scan: run
`scripts/install_precommit_hook.sh` once per clone to wire
`scripts/secret_scan.sh --staged` (Gitleaks on staged changes, fail-closed)
into `.git/hooks/pre-commit`. The ruleset is pinned to Gitleaks 8.30.1 so its
inherited detectors cannot drift. Provider credentials live only in the
ignored `.env`; never commit a populated `env` or `.env` file.

After a clean build, verify both tracked changes and newly generated files:

```powershell
git diff --exit-code -- server/static
if (git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all -- server/static) { throw "Uncommitted static output" }
```

POSIX (bash), exactly as the ubuntu-latest dashboard job runs it:

```bash
git diff --exit-code -- server/static
test -z "$(git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all -- server/static)"
```

When the bundle changed intentionally, review and commit every generated file.

## Adding behavior safely

1. Keep economic mutation in `engine/` or deterministic `world/` mechanics.
2. Define a structured action contract; never parse model prose into money.
3. Validate actor role, ownership, state, amount, and phase.
4. Route every monetary effect through the ledger.
5. Emit a durable event with enough IDs/values to audit the transition.
6. Add success, rejection, replay, and reconciliation tests.
7. Update metrics/API/dashboard/docs if the behavior is observable.

## Scale-270 economic acceptance

The maintained scale lane evaluates 270 sampled citizens, which Genesis expands
to 308 persisted agents after institutional staff and health-economy founders.
Run the provider-free diagnostic arms in separate ignored directories:

```bash
python scripts/run_scale_validation.py \
  --profile runs/acceptance/scale-270-baseline-120.yaml \
  --ticks 120 --label baseline-120 \
  --output-dir reports/out/scale-270/baseline/output \
  --data-dir reports/out/scale-270/baseline/runs

python scripts/run_scale_validation.py \
  --profile runs/acceptance/scale-270-recovery-120.yaml \
  --ticks 120 --label recovery-120 \
  --output-dir reports/out/scale-270/recovery/output \
  --data-dir reports/out/scale-270/recovery/runs
```

The harness prints the exact source database, replay database, and runtime
receipt identities. Evaluate each finalized pair without opening a writer,
replacing the three `<...>` values with those printed artifact paths:

```bash
python -m reports.scale_economic_health \
  --source <source-db> \
  --replay <replay-db> \
  --runtime-receipt <runtime-receipt> \
  --output benchmarks/receipts/scale-270/<arm>-economic-health
```

Exit `0` is a pass. Exit `10` is reserved for an economic-only failure in a
120-tick diagnostic arm after every operational, integrity, checkpoint, and
replay gate passed. Exit `5` is an operational, artifact, replay, unexpected,
or formal-horizon failure; exit `2` is command misuse. The formal provider-free
gate uses the same commands with this profile and horizon:

```bash
python scripts/run_scale_validation.py \
  --profile runs/acceptance/scale-270-recovery-1000.yaml \
  --ticks 1000 --label recovery-1000 \
  --output-dir reports/out/scale-270/formal/output \
  --data-dir reports/out/scale-270/formal/runs
```

Provider-free profiles reject `--approve-live-inference`; do not add that flag
to any command above. Paid profiles require the flag and are limited to their
maintained two-tick canaries. For example:

```bash
python scripts/run_scale_validation.py \
  --profile runs/scale-270-minimax-live.yaml \
  --ticks 2 --label minimax-two-tick \
  --output-dir reports/out/scale-270/minimax/output \
  --data-dir reports/out/scale-270/minimax/runs \
  --approve-live-inference

python scripts/run_scale_validation.py \
  --profile runs/scale-270-deepseek-live.yaml \
  --ticks 2 --label deepseek-two-tick \
  --output-dir reports/out/scale-270/deepseek/output \
  --data-dir reports/out/scale-270/deepseek/runs \
  --approve-live-inference
```

`reports/out/scale-270/` is ignored raw runtime storage. SQLite databases and
checkpoint bodies stay local there and are never committed. Only reviewed,
sanitized JSON/Markdown evidence belongs under
`benchmarks/receipts/scale-270/`; never copy credentials, private provider
bodies, reasoning, cookies, environment dumps, or database bytes into a public
receipt.

## Schema and compatibility

Run databases are scientific artifacts. Additive columns/tables are preferred.
New semantics that would change historical output must be gated by
`engine_semantics_version`; v1/v2 replay behavior must remain exact. Never
rewrite a stored source run during replay.

The [Semantics 15 household guide](semantics15-households.md) specifies schema 21
person origins, membership/custody, child needs, demographic keyed draws and
census reconciliation. Its focused tests are part of the required core CI job.

The [Semantics 16 randomness guide](semantics16-randomness.md) specifies daily
mechanism/origin keys, unchanged historical draws, and the opt-in goods/equity
pilot profile. Required research CI covers draw isolation and source/resume/replay
checks for both domains. It adds no database migration.

The [Semantics 17 household decision contract](plans/2026-09-07-household-decisions.md)
adds schema 22 proposals, adult assents, partnerships and atomic joint migration.
Run `tests/test_semantics17_household_decisions.py` for the focused core gate.
Its rehearsal uses the small city profile with real scripted decisions and no
provider calls. New state uses hash-contract-v4; older contracts remain frozen.
Complete estates and long-horizon household validation remain W5 work.

The [Semantics 18 daily time contract](plans/2026-09-07-daily-time-and-earned-wages.md)
adds schema 23 time budgets, delivered care, proportional labor and non-cash wage
claims. `runs/daily-time-rehearsal.yaml` is the bounded opt-in city profile;
`tests/test_semantics18_daily_time.py` is part of required core CI. Plans affect
the following day. Hash-contract-v5 includes the new authoritative journals;
v1–v4 files remain frozen. Use a fresh short pytest directory and keep at least
40 GiB free. Full estates, education cohorts and long-horizon validation remain.

Semantics 19 adds the [estate cash and credit checkpoint](plans/2026-09-07-estate-cash-and-credit.md).
Use `runs/estate-cash-rehearsal.yaml` and `tests/test_semantics19_estate_cash.py`
for the currency-separated cash inventory, principal recovery, bank losses,
rollback and replay. Schema 24 is additive; new receipts require hash-contract-v6.
Frozen v1–v5 files and prior simulation semantics remain unchanged. This is not
full asset succession or long-horizon validation.

The [Buzz-derived architecture boundaries](buzz-derived-architecture.md)
document the additive schema-20/Semantics-14 attendance contract, read-time
activity projection, proposal-only Builder support seam, and the separate
hosted control-plane audit migration.

## Documentation changes

Documentation ships with the behavior it describes. Use the
[documentation maintenance guide](documentation-maintenance.md) to identify
affected audiences, apply the source-of-truth hierarchy, update ADR status, and
run the maintained-link contract.

At minimum, a new durable guide must be linked from [the handbook](README.md)
and added to `HANDBOOK_DOCS` in `tests/test_documentation.py`. A new route,
profile, semantics version, hosted operation, or security boundary must update
its specialized guide rather than only the root README. Keep the historical
printable Semantics-7 status snapshot frozen and update the current
`implementation-status.md` ledger instead.

## Logging

Use `observability.log_event` for process diagnostics and `Store.log_event` for
scientific/economic evidence. Operational logs must be bounded and secret-safe;
the SQLite event spine may contain richer causal evidence but should still avoid
credentials. Successful per-call request/replay/resume records are DEBUG-only;
INFO is reserved for run-level milestones and unusual recovery. Add assertions
for important failure/recovery logs.

## CI and review

GitHub Actions builds the dashboard on Node.js 22 and runs Python 3.11/3.12 on
Ubuntu and Windows. Every PR also runs a single deterministic shard of the
engine/world/agents-focused tests via `scripts/pytest_shard.py`, so edits to
`run.py`, `llm/gateway.py`, `agents/`, `world/`, and `engine/` are exercised
before merge; the full cross-platform matrix remains a manual workflow
dispatch. Each OS/Python pair uses all 16 full-suite shards (indices 0–15),
with a 30-minute limit per job. A focused matrix override provides partial
coverage until every shard in the pair has a successful result.
The policy recovery and saved-world recovery suites each run across four
deterministic shards, retaining every test and the ten-minute job limit. Verbose
test names, duration summaries and a 90-second traceback make slow executions
diagnosable. Run research suites from an unchanged checkout: their manifests bind
the complete code identity, so edits during execution correctly invalidate them.
Failed dashboard checks retain Playwright traces and screenshots for seven days.
Hosted integration and Compose use the pinned MinIO server and client releases
from the publisher's `quay.io/minio` registry; changing the registry does not
upgrade the stored-data format or runtime version.
Pull requests should state behavior, tests, live calls/cost,
compatibility impact, and remaining risk. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
