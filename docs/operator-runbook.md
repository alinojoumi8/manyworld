# Operator runbook

## Safe startup

Run offline before using paid providers:

```powershell
python run.py --config runs/base.yaml --ticks 1
python -m pytest -q
```

Validate the production routes before a paid run:

```powershell
python run.py --config runs/acceptance/production.yaml --preflight-live
```

The production acceptance profile is uncapped but fully metered. Record the Git
commit, resolved profile, seed, population, provider/model catalog result, and
intended evidence gate before starting it.

## Optional R22 hosted deployment

Hosted mode is separate from `run.py --serve`. Copy deployment secrets into the
repository-root ignored `.env` file or an operator-controlled equivalent; the
commands below pass that file explicitly so Compose does not resolve a different
project-directory environment. Substitute another ignored `--env-file` path when
using a secret-manager export. At minimum set strong unique
`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `APP_DATABASE_PASSWORD`,
`SUPERVISOR_DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `MINIO_ROOT_USER`, `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`,
`S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` values plus the exact HTTPS
public origin/host. The MinIO root identity is bootstrap-only; the S3 identity
is the bucket/prefix-scoped runtime identity and has no delete permission. The
three PostgreSQL passwords are passed separately from password-free base
conninfo and escaped by psycopg, so strong passwords may contain URI-reserved
characters. Never put any populated value in committed YAML.

Validate and build the reference stack before first start:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml config --quiet
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml build app migrate
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml up -d postgres minio minio-init migrate app caddy prometheus
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml ps
```

The migration job must complete successfully before the application starts.
Bootstrap the first tenant/admin once, supplying the password through an
environment variable or the CLI's hidden prompt:

```powershell
$env:AGENT_ECONOMY_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD = '<temporary-strong-password>'
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml run --rm `
  -e AGENT_ECONOMY_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD `
  bootstrap bootstrap --config /app/config/hosted.migrate.docker.yaml `
  --tenant-slug research --tenant-name 'Research' `
  --admin-email admin@example.com --admin-name 'Initial Admin'
Remove-Item Env:AGENT_ECONOMY_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD
```

The hosted run selector exposes `v2`, `v2-rehearsal`, `r21-real-us`, and
`world-os-external`. Use `world-os-external` when an agent owner needs the
External agent connections menu: it explicitly enables the gateway on engine
semantics 10. The other maintained hosted profiles remain on semantics 7 for
replay compatibility. Do not upgrade an existing stored run in place; create a
new `world-os-external` run and attach the outside agent there.

Changing `.env` does not change passwords stored in an existing PostgreSQL
volume. Rotate all three database identities atomically with the profile-gated
job: keep the current `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, place new distinct values in
`APP_DATABASE_PASSWORD` and `SUPERVISOR_DATABASE_PASSWORD`, and temporarily set
`AGENT_ECONOMY_NEW_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to the new administrator password. Then:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml --profile ops run --rm rotate-database-passwords
# Replace POSTGRES_PASSWORD with the new administrator value and clear
# AGENT_ECONOMY_NEW_POSTGRES_PASSWORD in the protected environment file.
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml up -d --force-recreate app caddy
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml ps
```

Require readiness plus fresh administrator logins before retiring the old
secret-manager versions. The command rejects reused, short, or control-character
passwords and never prints them. If it fails, keep the old values and do not
recreate the app.

Verify `/health/live`, `/health/ready`, TLS, login, an observer invitation,
cross-tenant denial, one admin-controlled shared run, and Prometheus scraping.
For deployments that offer external connections, also create a paused
`world-os-external` run, issue one observer connection, copy its one-time token,
and verify that a semantics-7 run explains the incompatibility without sending
a creation request.

On supervisor recovery, the durable hosted catalog is reconciled before a run
can resume. A run-local external connection that is absent from the catalog, or
whose catalog record is revoked, is revoked locally; any still-pending dedicated
actor arrival is cancelled. A suspended catalog connection is suspended locally.
Reconciliation failure is fail-closed: the run is not loaded for traffic or
ticks until the catalog can be read and the local state is made safe.
Exact local image/Compose evidence at `53081f2` passed those checks plus immutable
S3 snapshot/cold restore, atomic password rotation, and 200/200 bounded load
requests with 80 enforced cross-tenant denials. PR #19 head `1cf1d0a` passed all
six CI jobs in run `29409250171`. This is local and CI acceptance evidence, not a
claim that a public production deployment exists.

Record a bounded authenticated load/isolation receipt with at least two users
from distinct tenants. Repeat `--user` as
`TENANT_UUID,EMAIL,PASSWORD_ENV[,RUN_UUID]`; the password itself must exist only
in the named environment variable:

```powershell
$env:LOAD_PASSWORD_A = '<tenant-a-password>'
$env:LOAD_PASSWORD_B = '<tenant-b-password>'
python -m hosted.load_test `
  --base-url https://economy.example.com `
  --user '<TENANT_A>,admin-a@example.com,LOAD_PASSWORD_A,<RUN_A>' `
  --user '<TENANT_B>,admin-b@example.com,LOAD_PASSWORD_B,<RUN_B>' `
  --requests-per-user 100 --concurrency 16 `
  --build-ref '<GIT_COMMIT>' `
  --output reports/out/hosted-load.json
Remove-Item Env:LOAD_PASSWORD_A,Env:LOAD_PASSWORD_B
```

The probe requires HTTPS, 2–32 distinct-tenant users, at most 10,000 total
requests, and concurrency of 1–256. `--requests-per-user` must cover every
configured operation at least once: three requests without run IDs and up to
five when both adjacent users include run IDs. It checks authenticated
own-scope reads plus cross-tenant 404 denial and cannot pass without a complete
isolation probe.
`--allow-insecure-loopback` disables certificate verification only for an HTTPS
loopback origin and is restricted to local smoke testing; it never permits
remote or plain-HTTP probes. The JSON receipt is sanitized: it contains no
passwords, cookies, email addresses, response bodies, or provider data. Record a
new receipt for every candidate deployment; the historical `53081f2` receipt
proves that exact local build only.

Operational commands use the same image/CLI:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml run --rm app readiness --config /app/config/hosted.docker.yaml
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml run --rm app snapshot-all --config /app/config/hosted.docker.yaml
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml run --rm app verify-snapshot --config /app/config/hosted.docker.yaml --tenant-id <TENANT_UUID> --run-id <RUN_UUID>
docker compose --env-file .env -f deploy/compose.yaml run --rm app restore-snapshot --config /app/config/hosted.docker.yaml --tenant-id <TENANT_UUID> --run-id <RUN_UUID>
```

`snapshot-all` attempts every active run before it reports: a run whose writer
lease is held by a live supervisor is skipped, and the command exits non-zero
with the list of skipped or failed runs only after the remaining runs have been
published. The writer lease is renewed while a large database is being backed
up, hashed, and uploaded.

Restore refuses to overwrite an existing run unless `--replace` is explicit.
Keep the privileged migration DSN out of the serving container, preserve
PostgreSQL and object-store volumes together, and rehearse restore before
calling backups operational.

Run the free acceptance rehearsal and inspect its failed/live-only gates before
authorizing inference:

```powershell
python run.py --config runs/acceptance/rehearsal.yaml `
  --acceptance-run `
  --experiment-evidence reports/out/experiment_rumor_vs_control.json
```

The first pass intentionally lacks run-bound reviewed phenomena and uses only
scripted providers. After it reaches tick 365, copy the template, set its
top-level `run_id` to the exact rehearsal run, and document three distinct
phenomena from that run before regenerating the receipt:

```powershell
Copy-Item runs/acceptance/phenomena.template.yaml `
  reports/out/rehearsal_<RUN_ID>_phenomena.yaml
# Review and edit the copied YAML; do not reuse evidence from another run.
python run.py --acceptance-report <RUN_ID> `
  --experiment-evidence reports/out/experiment_rumor_vs_control.json `
  --phenomena-evidence reports/out/rehearsal_<RUN_ID>_phenomena.yaml
python run.py --replay <RUN_ID>
```

The completed scripted rehearsal should fail only `real_providers`. Reaching
the replay horizon is not exact-replay proof: retain the verifier output and
require `exact: true`, identical source/replay ticks and hashes, and
`differences: []` before marking replay complete.

## Capped research-validity pilot

The 30-tick pilot is the first paid gate. It targets the current depositors of
the largest bank, hides private reserve ratios from citizens, and caps recorded
spend at $25:

```powershell
python run.py --config runs/acceptance/pilot.yaml `
  --acceptance-run --serve --approve-live-inference
```

The served form keeps the observatory and `/api/acceptance/status` available
throughout the run. The authorized acceptance driver auto-starts and pauses
fail-closed if an exact Oracle checkpoint was passed without a persisted
prediction. Omit `--serve` only for unattended headless execution.

Do not start the full run unless this receipt passes its rumor, conversation,
belief-history, deposit-outflow, ledger, provider, latency, and spend gates. Do
not resume `f7c6238bf5`; it is preserved as a pre-fix diagnostic pilot.

## Oracle calibration campaign

This campaign measures Oracle latency and calibration; it is not the 365-day
whole-world acceptance run. V7 and V8 are archived incomplete diagnostic
campaigns. V8 seeds 7371–7374 passed individually, but seed 7375 exhausted the
Kimi billing-cycle quota and made the fixed campaign ineligible. The current
pending `oracle-calibration-v9` commitment uses fresh seeds 7381–7390: odd
seeds are control and even seeds are rumor arms. Its ten predeclared profiles
keep background behavior scripted and route only the Oracle to `MiniMax-M3`
through the exact `openai_compat` adapter under a `$25` per-run cap. Do not
replace a seed or switch control/treatment arms after seeing outcomes. Treatment profiles
lock a one-person public precursor one tick before each forecast and the larger
depositor-targeted rumor one tick after it; control profiles contain neither.

First run the free 335-tick control and treatment rehearsals. They exercise the
same six governed questions and resolution horizon but are deliberately
ineligible for a live campaign receipt because their Oracle is scripted:

```powershell
python run.py --config runs/oracle/calibration-control-rehearsal.yaml `
  --acceptance-run
python run.py --config runs/oracle/calibration-rehearsal.yaml `
  --acceptance-run
```

This rehearsal is mechanics evidence, not a release receipt. The generic
acceptance command may return nonzero because scripted-provider provenance is
ineligible; inspect and resolve any other failed check. The live campaign
profiles below must still satisfy their stricter source checks.

The archived `oracle-calibration-v1-s7301` source completed tick 335 with six
resolved forecasts and valid provider provenance. Its replay nonetheless
diverged at the first arrival because staged genesis reset an uncheckpointed
persona RNG stream, and checkpoint inspection retained SQLite WAL/SHM sidecars.
It is diagnostic evidence only: do not resume it, copy it into a manifest, or
reuse its responses. The preceding branch fixes for persona RNG restore,
standalone checkpoint finalization, replay target-tick enforcement, and
column-specific pre-dispatch RNG validation pass the focused and full gates.

The immutable `oracle-calibration-v2-s7311` source and generated offline replay
both reached tick 335 and crossed the arrival that invalidated v1. Canonical
verification returned `exact: true` with `differences: []`. Receipt generation
then failed because checkpoint integrity required exactly 100 total
agent rows. Lifecycle correctly preserved one deceased row and created its
replacement arrival, yielding 101 stored rows, 100 living, and one deceased.
Do not resume, rewrite, or reuse any v2 source, replay, claim, checkpoint, or
response. The receipt correction validates the bounded living population,
requires stored total to equal living plus deceased, and rejects invalid
lifecycle state. It also requires each death to create one chronologically valid
schedule, each due schedule to produce exactly one linked arrival, the fixed
5–20-tick delay, and authentic `NIGHT_CLOSE` phase plus agent-subject provenance
for death and arrival events.

The excluded `oracle-calibration-v3-s7321` source and exact companion replay then
completed tick 335. Its original receipt admitted only four of six forecasts
because it applied accepted-plan validation to authenticated planner attempts
that had been rejected before valid retries. The original receipt records the
pre-inspection source SHA-256. The local source artifact was later write-opened
during diagnosis, so it is not admissible even as a corrected v3 sample. Do not
resume it, regenerate its no-clobber receipt, or reuse any v3 response, claim,
checkpoint, replay, or seed.

V4 seeds 7331 and 7332 produced eligible exact source/replay receipts. Preserve
them as diagnostic evidence only: do not resume, rewrite, regenerate, list, or
reuse any v4 source, response, claim, checkpoint, replay, or seed. V4 seed 7333
also completed an exact source/replay pair, but the receipt correctly excluded
its tick-125 forecast, run, and fixed campaign. Planner attempt 1 requested
`get_ledger_summary` for `entity_type: gov`. Runtime queried only
`accounts.owner_type='gov'`, while the treasury is stored as
`owner_type='system', label='sys:gov'`, returned
`entity ledger accounts not found`, and then incorrectly labeled and retried
that post-preflight execution failure as `oracle_tool_plan_rejected`. Attempt 2
failed the independently reproducible
`names must contain 1 to 10 valid metric names` contract; attempt 3 succeeded.
The receipt could not independently reproduce or bind attempt 1 and therefore
failed closed. Do not regenerate the no-clobber v4 receipts or substitute a
later v4 arm.

V5 introduced one scheduled-tick, catalog-aware preflight in both runtime and receipt
audit. It validates historical tick bounds and the advertised agent, firm,
bank, and ledger entity IDs before any read executes. Government ledger reads
map to the system-owned `sys:gov` treasury, so the catalog and executor agree.
A failure after successful preflight is logged as a tool execution failure and
is not retried as a planner rejection. Legitimate rejected plans still bind the
full independently reproduced error, matching rejection event, plan hash, and
monotonic attempt ordinal; only the final accepted plan is validated as
executed evidence. Replay-receipt creation continues to reject source or replay
WAL/SHM sidecars immediately.

Conservative storage cleanup for the earlier v2–v4 diagnostics removed 200
superseded checkpoint database bodies—40 for v2, 40 for v3, and 120 for v4—and
recovered `45.369270 GiB`. All 200 runtime checkpoint manifests and every final
source/replay database remain.

V5 seeds 7341–7347 produced passed, eligible source receipts with exact
companion replays. Seed 7348 finalized its source, but duplicate same-tick loan
defaults shared one bounded public citation identity. The two editor responses
at tick 301 each matched two candidates and the two at tick 331 each matched
three; replay failed closed those four articles to daily briefs and nine
information tables diverged. Seeds 7349–7350 were never run. The seven
receipt-bound replay databases and fourteen Oracle source/replay receipts belong
only to seeds 7341–7347; seed 7348 has no eligible replay database or Oracle
source/replay receipt. Final corrected offline replay
`replay-oracle-calibration-v5-s7348-5220b912ae` reached tick 335 with
`exact: true`, identical logical hash `fee77b65…b378`, all 82 deterministic
tables exact, and `differences: []`; it is post-source diagnostic proof and
creates no eligible v5 receipt. Verified cleanup removed 320 v5
source-checkpoint database bodies, 160 fixed-code replay checkpoint bodies,
four derived fixed-replay final databases, and the superseded partial seed-7343
replay: 485 database files and `111.945217 GiB` total. The retained archive
contains all authoritative final sources; the seven eligible replay databases
and fourteen source/replay receipts for seeds 7341–7347; all source-checkpoint
manifests/hashes, claims, and reports; the 160 fixed-code replay checkpoint
manifests; and the ignored compact final exact receipt. Seed 7348 remains
excluded and has no eligible source/replay receipt or retained replay database. Do not
resume the fixed corpus or copy any v5 artifact into a later campaign.

V6 retained the shared preflight and mapped duplicate public-event citations by
their deterministic source occurrence. Missing, out-of-range, or inconsistent
equivalence classes still failed closed. Its first arm, seed 7351, stopped at
tick 65 after a successful Kimi answer returned `confidence: "medium"` instead
of the strict `low|med|high` value. Runtime persisted `oracle_rule_rejected`, an
`insufficient_data` prediction, and `acceptance_checkpoint_missed`. Spend was
$0.18351, with no provider, budget, or tool-execution failure. Preserve v6 as
excluded diagnostic evidence; do not resume, rewrite, repair, or substitute
seed 7351. Seeds 7352–7360 were never run and must remain unused by v6.

V7 seeds 7361–7364 each produced passed, eligible source receipts and exact
335-tick companion replays with zero differences. Preserve them as diagnostic
evidence only. Seed 7365 is paused at tick 335 in `FINALIZE`; its authoritative
standalone database is `data/runs/oracle-calibration-v7-s7365.db`, 518,561,792
bytes, SHA-256
`b48b0c5a02270f6b09eafb5c32c8480a44f42057289048faedde9474d8ca8ce5`.
Opening it with SQLite URI `mode=ro&immutable=1` and `query_only=ON` returns
`quick_check: ok`. It has no WAL/SHM sidecars and records
32,114 persisted calls, 12 Oracle calls, six resolved forecasts/checkpoints, no
critical events, balanced USD, and `$0.2754108` spend. Receipt production found
persisted scheduled E2E of 13,658 ms below the 13,660 ms governed-call sum.
Seed 7365 has no replay database or receipt, seeds 7366–7370 were never run, and
there is no V7 aggregate manifest or receipt.

The common scheduled-latency producer now clamps both continuous monotonic and
resumed wall-clock duration to at least the sum of conservatively rounded
governed call latencies. Seed 7365's claim binds commit
`7642d7a193f8d0806d6043e8b105b6f469f649c8` and tree
`d9e02a64efd555fb6d0a5c1414351a6db238ad62`. The claim SHA-256 is
`705dadfe8e9ed8588d0a4329bf0e681ce2f83e2a531ff40ee94c783d83f1f18e`; the
initialized-marker SHA-256 is
`f07efa9e3ff5452aa4aea6ff560a4974c86c839fac7b9aa9e5c78aeb0f900bfd`.
Because the campaign command is the
only receipt path and re-preparation requires the clean revision to match that
claim byte-for-byte, never resume it or mint a post-fix eligible receipt. A
post-fix replay may be retained only as diagnostic evidence. No V7 artifact or
seed enters V8.

V8 is archived and excluded. Seeds 7371–7374 each produced passed, eligible
source receipts and exact tick-335 companion replays. Seed 7375 stopped at tick
245 after four of six forecasts when Kimi returned HTTP 403 for the exhausted
billing-cycle quota. Its source persisted one `provider_failure`, spent
`$0.19651848`, passes immutable SQLite health checks, and has no WAL/SHM
sidecars. Do not resume, repair, substitute, or post-fix receipt that arm. The
archive retains five source databases, four replay databases, eight
source/replay receipts, and every checkpoint manifest. After the archive
commit became durable, conservative cleanup removed exactly 189 V8 source-checkpoint
database bodies matching anchored regex
`^oracle-calibration-v8-s737[1-5]_t\d+\.db$`—40 each for seeds 7371–7374 and
29 for seed 7375—totalling 43,999,223,808 bytes. Retain 189 source checkpoint manifests, 160 replay
checkpoint manifests, five claims, five initialized markers, and the final
artifacts listed above. The verified post-cleanup inventory contains zero
source/replay checkpoint bodies and zero V8 SQLite sidecars. All nine retained
final databases pass immutable read-only `quick_check`, and eligible source/
replay hashes match their receipts. Never use a broad V8 wildcard. No V8
artifact or seed enters V9.

V9 has the same direct acceptance-rehearsal ancestry, governed-answer repair,
fixed latency producer, engine semantics 7, and database schema 11. It is a
fresh campaign/version/seed/config commitment: `oracle-calibration-v9`, version
9, seeds 7381–7390, odd control/even rumor, and commitment SHA-256
`8a1845ebe9e916b8618a1c17170dc8a2b439c929ea1e1118670e21683c341a8e`.
Only the Oracle is live. Its exact adapter is provider kind `openai_compat`,
base URL `https://api.minimax.io/v1`, key environment `MINIMAX_API_KEY`,
`healthcheck_path: /models`, 180-second timeout,
`max_tokens_field: max_completion_tokens`, request defaults
`max_completion_tokens: 4096` and `reasoning_split: true`, and
`prompt_cache_mode: provider_automatic`, with model `MiniMax-M3`. Use the
standard ≤512k prices configured in the profile: `$0.30/M` input, `$1.20/M`
output, and `$0.06/M` automatic cache reads. The per-run cap is `$25`.

A disposable one-call MiniMax probe and a deliberately unclaimed five-tick
Oracle rehearsal both succeeded through this exact adapter. They establish
operational readiness only; neither created a V9 corpus claim or receipt. No V9
live evidence is claimed until all ten arms and the aggregate gate pass.

Preflight and execute each profile from `v9-seed-7381-control.yaml` through
`v9-seed-7390-rumor.yaml`. The first run is shown; repeat it for the exact ten
checked-in profiles only after seed 7381 produces an eligible exact
source/replay receipt:

```powershell
python run.py --config runs/oracle/v9-seed-7381-control.yaml --preflight
python run.py --config runs/oracle/v9-seed-7381-control.yaml --preflight-live
python run.py --config runs/oracle/v9-seed-7381-control.yaml `
  --oracle-campaign-run --approve-live-inference
```

`--oracle-campaign-run` is the profile-specific source path: it runs the six
checkpoints, writes the report, finalizes the source SQLite database, replays it
offline, finalizes the replay database, verifies exact hashes/provenance, and
writes a source receipt plus a ready-to-copy manifest entry. It exits nonzero if
the source or companion replay is ineligible.

Start and resume these runs only from a completely clean Git worktree. The
exclusive sample claim binds `HEAD`, `HEAD^{tree}`, and the canonical
`data/runs` location before genesis. Claim and initialized-state files are
fsynced as temporary artifacts and atomically published into no-clobber slots.
The command holds one OS-backed per-seed execution lock from initialization
through source/replay receipt publication; a concurrent resume exits before it
can dispatch, and an exited or crashed process releases the lock automatically.

Genesis is built under a unique temporary directory, finalized, and validated
as reconciled tick-0 state with zero model calls. It is then atomically
hard-linked through canonical pending and final no-clobber slots. A valid pending
genesis resumes without rebuilding. A partial/corrupt pending publication is
quarantined and only the deterministic zero-call genesis is rebuilt; a missing
database after initialization or a partial final database still fails closed.
Source and replay databases must both remain directly under canonical
`data/runs`.

The replay execution receipt records every consumed logical source call, its
digest, exact-key versus compatibility-fallback counts, and live-dispatch count;
release evidence requires complete one-time consumption, zero fallback, and zero
dispatch. Every required checkpoint is independently quick-checked, matched to
the full schema, bound to the source run/config/tick and valid engine/lifecycle
PRNG state, then hashed into the replay and source receipts. All persisted model
calls are audited globally: only the six scheduled governed Oracle sessions may
use the pinned live MiniMax route. Claims, markers, replay receipts, source receipts,
and final campaign receipts are immutable no-clobber publications; an identical
rerun may reuse an existing receipt, while any differing artifact fails.

These controls are strong local accident/tamper evidence only. They are not an
administrator-proof attestation: an administrator who can rewrite the code,
databases, claims, and receipts can forge a new internally consistent local
package. Public release evidence **requires** independent external signing or a
separately administered append-only transparency log; the local CLI receipt
alone is insufficient for that claim.

The campaign command does the offline replay itself; do not invoke a separate
manual `--replay` and substitute it into the corpus. After each command exits,
confirm the emitted source receipt reports finalized source/replay databases and
no `-wal` or `-shm` sidecar. Preserve the emitted manifest entry before any
storage cleanup.

Run the ten arms sequentially and use this checkpoint retention boundary:

- Keep every `oracle-calibration-v9-s*_t*.db` source checkpoint body and its
  `.manifest.json` through the aggregate report. The evaluator reopens each
  physical source checkpoint, rebuilds its runtime manifest, runs SQLite and
  ledger checks, and rejects a missing body; a receipt hash alone is not enough.
- After one arm has emitted a passed source receipt and its manifest entry is
  durably recorded, archive or prune only that arm's
  `replay-oracle-calibration-v9-*_t*.db` checkpoint bodies. Retain their tiny
  manifests, the final replay database under `data/runs`, the final source
  database, and all source checkpoint bodies. Resolve and verify the exact
  replay run ID and checkpoint-directory paths before removal; never use a broad
  campaign wildcard.
- At v5 artifact sizes, retaining all twenty source/replay checkpoint families
  would consume about `192–198 GiB`. Sequentially pruning replay checkpoint
  bodies keeps the ten-arm peak near `110–114 GiB`; monitor free space before
  each arm and stop before the safety margin is exhausted.
- Only after the aggregate JSON/Markdown receipt has passed and the evidence
  package is durably archived may all ten arms' 400 V9 source checkpoint
  database bodies (40 per arm) be pruned. Retain their manifests, final
  source/replay databases, claims, and receipts.

The separate V7 archive cleanup is complete. It removed exactly the 200 source
checkpoint database bodies in `data/checkpoints` matching anchored filename regex
`^oracle-calibration-v7-s736[1-5]_t\d+\.db$`. The verified reclaim is
49,647,239,168 bytes (`46.237595 GiB`): seed 7361 has 40 bodies totaling
9,700,835,328 bytes (`9.034607 GiB`); 7362 has 40 totaling 10,008,035,328
(`9.320709 GiB`); 7363 has 40 totaling 9,875,501,056 (`9.197277 GiB`); 7364
has 40 totaling 10,006,319,104 (`9.319111 GiB`); and 7365 has 40 totaling
10,056,548,352 (`9.365891 GiB`). Every body has a sibling manifest and none has
a sidecar. No broad V7 wildcard was used. All 360 source/replay checkpoint
manifests and hashes, five final source databases, four final replay databases, eight
source/replay receipt JSONs for seeds 7361–7364, the five existing
claim/initialized-marker pairs for seeds 7361–7365, profiles, commitments,
template, base configuration, reports, and the authoritative seed-7365 database
were retained.

Only after all ten source claims and runs finish, copy
`runs/oracle/manifest-v9.template.yaml` to a run-specific evidence manifest and
replace its ten placeholders with the exact manifest entries emitted by the
source receipts, then evaluate it:

```powershell
Copy-Item runs/oracle/manifest-v9.template.yaml runs/oracle/manifest-v9.yaml
python run.py --oracle-calibration-report runs/oracle/manifest-v9.yaml
```

The command reads disposable copies rather than opening the sources directly,
never scans a directory for candidates, recomputes every companion replay proof,
and writes deterministic JSON and Markdown receipts under `reports/out`. A
release PASS requires all ten runs to remain eligible, at least 60 resolved
forecasts spanning outcomes 0 and 1,
nearest-rank `scheduled_e2e_v1` p90 strictly below 60,000 ms, aggregate Brier
strictly below the fixed p=0.5 baseline of 0.25, and unchanged source/profile
hashes. Any excluded run fails the complete-manifest gate.

Run aggregate verification serially on a machine with at least 6 GB of free
memory. A measured 335-tick scripted source contained 129,764 events and 31,880
model-call rows in a roughly 0.48 GB database; its full exact-table proof took
about 136 seconds and peaked near 4.1 GB working set on the development machine.
The evaluator releases each pair before opening the next, but parallel campaign
verification is not the supported operator path.

## Production acceptance

Start a fresh acceptance run only with explicit live-inference authorization:

```powershell
python run.py --config runs/acceptance/production.yaml `
  --acceptance-run --serve --approve-live-inference `
  --experiment-evidence reports/out/experiment_rumor_vs_control.json `
  --phenomena-evidence reports/out/<reviewed-phenomena>.yaml
```

The driver runs to scheduled Oracle checkpoints and then the configured
365-tick horizon. It schedules six questions and requires all six persisted
`scheduled_e2e_v1` latency samples. Each sample starts before Oracle planning,
ends after the forecast contract is validated, and is bound to the exact
prediction, campaign key, question, and tick. Manual calls cannot satisfy the
gate; a missing, dangling, malformed, or duplicate completion reference marks
the checkpoint invalid. Continuous monotonic and resumed wall-clock measurements
are both clamped to at least the sum of conservatively rounded governed call
latencies. The profile is uncapped for runtime continuity but has a
separate $200 efficiency completion gate. On success it writes the complete
HTML report plus JSON and Markdown acceptance receipts.

A passing acceptance receipt is not an exact-replay receipt. After the source
run closes, execute `python run.py --replay <RUN_ID>`, retain the companion
database and verifier output, and require `exact: true`, identical source/replay
ticks and hashes, and `differences: []`.

The production profile starts with exactly 100 living agents: 63 sampled
citizens plus engine-owned institutional and health-economy actors. The
population gate counts living agents, while deceased rows remain preserved for
lineage and replay as stable-population replacements arrive.

Copy `runs/acceptance/phenomena.template.yaml` to a run-specific reviewed file,
set its top-level `run_id` to the exact reviewed run, and replace the pending
examples with phenomena visible in that run's persisted metrics. Evidence for a
different run fails closed even when its metric direction happens to match.

During a run, `GET /api/acceptance/status` and the dashboard show completed
gates, actual/projected spend, Oracle sample count, shock traces, and rumor
window evidence. They also show the exact checkpoint schedule, next scheduled
question, persisted checkpoint result, and any missed checkpoint that stopped
the run. The status endpoint evaluates large databases off the server
event loop and may return evidence cached for up to two seconds. Once a final
receipt exists for the exact run ID and completed tick, the endpoint returns
that artifact so experiment and reviewed-phenomena gates remain visible.

## Cooldown, pause, and resume

HTTP 429 throttling and explicit provider overloads such as MiniMax HTTP 529
enter one provider-wide cooldown. The dashboard/status surface shows provider,
attempt count, remaining cooldown, and next retry. The run waits until recovery
or operator stop.

Other continuing provider failures use bounded retries and then pause cleanly.
`run_meta.tick` remains the last fully completed tick; `active_tick` and
`next_phase` identify the exact work to resume. Successful LLM responses are
already durable and are reused by request key.

Resume a stored production acceptance run with its original profile:

```powershell
python run.py --config runs/acceptance/production.yaml `
  --resume <RUN_ID> --acceptance-run --approve-live-inference `
  --experiment-evidence reports/out/experiment_rumor_vs_control.json `
  --phenomena-evidence reports/out/<reviewed-phenomena>.yaml
```

Do not replace or edit a partial database. Preserve it and resume it. Legacy
databases with ambiguous partial-tick semantics are marked `legacy_partial` and
must be treated explicitly rather than silently advanced.

## Dashboard controls

- **Run** starts or resumes continuous ticks.
- **Pause** interrupts a provider cooldown or requests a safe phase pause.
- **Step** executes one tick and leaves the run paused.
- **Speed** changes wall-clock delay only; status is authoritative after refresh.
- **Stop + report** finishes the current run and generates a report.

A reported run can be reopened through Run or Step; the previous report path is
cleared and a later stop generates a fresh report. A `halted` run cannot be
mutated because halt represents an invariant failure requiring investigation.

## Participant sandbox

Participant mode is a separate provider-free extension and is never enabled in
an acceptance profile:

```powershell
python run.py --config runs/participant.yaml
```

At a completed-day boundary, open a living citizen, take control, and queue one
action for the next day. Continuous **Run** is disabled; **Step** remains locked
until an explicit action (including **Do nothing**) is queued. The server owns
all hidden entity IDs, validates the command against the citizen's current
role-scoped action catalogue, then sends it through the normal action executor
and double-entry ledger. Control and action records survive restart, replay
without live input, appear as paginated history in the citizen inspector, and
release automatically if the citizen dies.

## Reports and exact replay

Regenerate a report from a stored run:

```powershell
python run.py --report <RUN_ID>
```

The HTML file is the canonical standalone report. Markdown is its
reviewer-oriented companion.

Rebuild a run without provider calls and verify canonical table digests:

```powershell
python run.py --replay <RUN_ID>
```

Replay re-asks persisted Oracle questions at their original ticks. Historical
prompt changes use the source call's semantic identity and copy its original
request and cache key. A missing stored response fails closed; replay never
falls back to a live provider.

## Experiments and acceptance-only evaluation

```powershell
python run.py --experiment runs/experiments/rumor_vs_control.yaml
python run.py --acceptance-report <RUN_ID> `
  --experiment-evidence reports/out/experiment_rumor_vs_control.json `
  --phenomena-evidence reports/out/<reviewed-phenomena>.yaml
```

The first command creates isolated treatment/control worlds. The second derives
an evidence receipt from persisted run data without advancing the simulation.

## Independent external connector evidence

The external connector finalizer targets an already deployed HTTPS test tenant.
It never creates a tenant, deploys infrastructure, invokes a native client, or
authorizes provider or hosting spend. Before each invocation, record the exact
candidate commit/tree, hosted origin, tenant/run, independent signer, expected
infrastructure cost, and receipt/source retention period. Approval is per
connector; one checked line does not authorize any other line:

- [ ] Independent MCP client, including OAuth and protected-resource discovery.
- [ ] Hermes, including exactly three completed wakes and executed receipts.
- [ ] OpenClaw, including exactly three completed wakes and executed receipts.
- [ ] Independent Python client submit/read flow.
- [ ] Independent TypeScript client submit/read flow.

Run the selected native client first. It must write one sanitized
`agent-economy-native-connector-result-v1` JSON artifact with the candidate,
hosted-origin hash, public exchange hashes, executed receipt IDs/hashes, and its
actual implementation provenance. The accepted implementation identities are
`official_mcp_conformance`, `hermes_cli`, `openclaw_cli`,
`agent_economy_python_client`, and `agent_economy_typescript_client`; the
selected connector determines the only eligible identity. The artifact also
records the native version plus SHA-256 hashes for its executable and sanitized
invocation. The independent MCP artifact must pin protocol revision
`2025-11-25`. Free-form client labels cannot substitute for this provenance.

Put the still-active process-only credential and a cross-tenant isolation probe
path in an ignored JSON file. On POSIX, give the file mode `600`; the finalizer
verifies that mode and current-user ownership. On Windows, restrict the file ACL
to the current user before invoking it; Python's `st_mode` cannot represent or
verify that ACL. On both platforms it refuses symlinks/reparse points, verifies
that the opened credential is the one it inspected, refuses loopback/private
targets, re-reads every native receipt from the server, verifies tenant/run/
actor/scope identity, runs isolation, revokes the credential, and confirms the
post-revocation `401`.

The finalizer emits two immutable files: a detailed
`agent-economy-external-connector-v2` receipt and the generic release-gate
wrapper consumed by `reports/release_evidence.py`. The release collector then
revalidates both files and the original native artifact offline:

```bash
python scripts/run_external_connector_acceptance.py \
  --connector independent_mcp \
  --base-url https://HOSTED_TEST_ORIGIN \
  --commit <CANDIDATE_COMMIT> --tree <CANDIDATE_TREE> \
  --credential-file <IGNORED_MODE_600_JSON> \
  --native-result benchmarks/receipts/release-v1/independent-mcp-native.json \
  --output benchmarks/receipts/release-v1/independent-mcp-detail.json \
  --release-gate-output benchmarks/receipts/release-v1/independent-mcp.json \
  --repo-root . \
  --signer-label <INDEPENDENT_SIGNER> \
  --server-operator <SERVER_OPERATOR>
```

Repeat only after separately approving the selected connector. A local mock,
same-operator signer, failed revocation/isolation probe, short wake set, or
receipt that contains credentials or private payloads is ineligible. The
`--rehearsal` mode exercises the hosted REST surface with urllib, but always
writes `execution_scope: local` under a rehearsal-only schema. It cannot satisfy
any of the five native connector gates, regardless of `--connector`.

## Hosted audit chain

Hosted migration 003 chains new administrative/control-plane audit rows within
each tenant. This is separate from the SQLite simulation event log.

For every deployment candidate and after a hosted security incident:

1. Open an authorized read-only PostgreSQL transaction under the exact tenant
   scope being verified.
2. Select only that tenant's audit rows, including `tenant_id`,
   `tenant_sequence`, `previous_entry_hash`, `entry_hash`,
   `actor_user_id`, `action`, `target_type`, `target_id`,
   `request_id`, `details_json`, and `created_at`.
3. Put legacy rows with all three chain fields null before the chained rows;
   order chained rows by ascending `tenant_sequence`.
4. Pass the rows to `hosted.audit_chain.verify_audit_chain(rows,
   tenant_id=...)`.
5. Require `valid` to be true. Record the legacy count as an explicit
   pre-migration limitation.
6. Retain the newest `tenant_sequence` and `entry_hash` in a protected
   location separate from PostgreSQL, with deployment/backup identity and
   capture time.

Treat a sequence gap, cross-tenant row, malformed hash, previous-hash mismatch,
content-hash mismatch, or partially chained row as an incident. Stop sensitive
administrative changes, preserve the database and separately retained head,
identify the first failing sequence, and investigate catalog/database access
before restoring service. Do not rewrite rows to make verification pass.

The chain detects mutation, middle deletion, reordering, or tenant mixing in
the supplied records. Detecting tail truncation requires comparison with the
separately retained head. Because the chain is not externally anchored, it is
tamper-evident rather than non-repudiation; a privileged operator able to
replace both database and retained heads can construct another consistent
history.

There is no public audit-chain verification endpoint. Keep raw tenant audit rows
within the authorized operations boundary and publish only a sanitized
verification receipt when evidence must be shared.

## Evidence retention

For a release candidate, retain:

1. `data/runs/<run-id>.db` and its latest checkpoint;
2. the finalized companion replay database and captured exact-verifier output;
3. the HTML report and JSON/Markdown acceptance receipts;
4. the experiment JSON/Markdown/HTML artifacts;
5. the reviewed phenomena YAML and shock traces;
6. the exact Git commit, resolved profile, and provider preflight result.

For a hosted candidate, also retain the sanitized audit-chain verification,
separate chain head, snapshot verification/restore receipts, and bounded
multi-tenant isolation/load receipt. Apply the configured audit and run-data
retention policy; do not publish raw tenant identities or details.

Never call a provider pause, partial report, failed replay, or incomplete
evidence package a successful acceptance.

PR #20 implementation is authorized for squash merge after its complete local
gate. Keep tagging, publication, and public deployment blocked until the V9
Oracle campaign, capped 30-day rumor pilot, 365-day/$200 acceptance run, and
final provenance/license/dependency/secret audit all pass under separate
authorization.
