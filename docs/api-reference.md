# Local and hosted API reference

The dashboard uses the same REST and WebSocket interfaces available to local
tools. Local mode has no account authentication; keep the server on localhost.
Local operator actions additionally require the operator session's CSRF token. FastAPI exposes
interactive OpenAPI documentation at `/docs` while the app is running.

## Committed City activity

`GET /api/v2/city/activity` returns an ordinary observer envelope for one committed
day. Parameters are `tick=live|N`, optional `fork_id`, `offset` (default 0),
`limit` (1–200, default 40), optional positive `actor_id`, `category`, and optional
`through_id` to keep pagination at one event high-water mark. Categories are
all, work, markets, learning, business, construction, travel, communications,
external, civic and other. Invalid category, cursor and future ticks are rejected.

`total`, `counts`, `changed_agents`, `actor_activity` and `marker_events` cover
the complete filtered day; `items` and `next_offset` page its cards. `day_total`
retains the unfiltered count. Cards expose vetted actor/firm identities, explicit
outcome labels and bounded public scalar details. They do not expose arbitrary
event payloads, private reasoning or external request bodies. Unknown event kinds
have neutral recorded headers. These read-only routes do not mutate economic
state or contact a model provider.

`GET /api/v2/city/news` and `GET /api/v2/city/conversations` read exactly the chosen
day, support `limit` and descending positive `before_id`, and return
`next_before_id` for pagination. News retains the existing grounded-number
redaction. Public conversations are separate from authorization-scoped
communication threads. All reads retain the selected fork/tick boundaries.

## Local research operator

`/api/v2/operator/research` provides the local study library, reviewed drafts,
durable jobs and private exports. Every request requires the current `run_id`,
`tick=live`, the current `fork_id` when applicable and `X-CSRF-Token` from the
operator session. Hosted-safe instances reject these routes. Responses use
`Cache-Control: private, no-store`.

`GET /capabilities` lists the fixed scripted pilot and valid owner-configured
policy designs. `POST /drafts/validate` accepts either G2/F2 parameters or a
strict `preset: "POLICY"` request with reviewed design identity, explicit source
worlds, model draws and original limits. No validation step contacts a provider.
`GET /drafts/{id}` returns the reviewed protocol without gateway configuration,
credential references or private paths.

`POST /drafts/{id}/launch` binds the draft hash and idempotency key. Policy
drafts additionally require literal `approve_live_inference: true`. The
supervisor repeats all source/design checks and charges preflight to the
original allowance. `POST /jobs/{id}/resume` accepts only the original progress
hash, compatibility-check hash and idempotency key, never replacement caps.
Both writes return 202 and preserve existing jobs on an identical retry.

`GET /studies/{id}?result_sha256=...` independently verifies evidence before
comparison. V3 policy frames retain distinct model draws and use separate
pending and final contracts. Private exports require the displayed result and
verification hashes. See the [complete endpoint table](research/price-lab.md#local-operator-api)
and [operator policy specification](plans/2026-09-07-policy-operator-workflow.md#owner-configuration-and-request-contract)
for fields, directory configuration, admission bounds and recovery semantics.

## Hosted R22 boundary

The optional hosted application is a separate authenticated entry point. It
sets secure `__Host-ae_session` and CSRF cookies; every mutation must include
the CSRF cookie value in the header named by `GET /api/v2/mode` (currently
`X-AE-CSRF`). Observers are read-only; admins manage membership, runs, and
controls. Cross-tenant resources return 404.

| Method | Path | Role / result |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v2/mode` | Public hosted capabilities and profile names; never secrets |
| `POST` | `/auth/register` | Redeem a one-time tenant invitation |
| `POST` | `/auth/login` | Tenant UUID, email, and password; sets session + CSRF cookies |
| `POST` | `/auth/logout` | Authenticated mutation; revokes the session |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/session` | Current user and role |
| `POST` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/invitations` | Admin; returns the credential once |
| `POST` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/invitations/revoke` | Admin |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/members` | Admin |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/members/{user}` | Admin; role/status update with self-lockout guard |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/runs` | Observer/admin tenant run catalog |
| `POST` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/runs` | Admin; creates one SQLite-backed run from an allowlisted profile |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/runs/{run}` | Catalog and available runtime status |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/runs/{run}` | Admin ownership transfer; lifecycle changes use control |
| `POST` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/runs/{run}/control` | Admin; `start`, `pause`, `stop`, `step`, or `speed` |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/runs/{run}/world/{path}` | Bounded, sanitized read-only world API proxy |
| `WS` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant}/runs/{run}/ws` | Authenticated tenant/run event stream |

Hosted world proxy routes are allowlisted. Mutations, reports/static file
mounts, replay discovery, arbitrary paths, provider configuration, prompt
payloads, and credentials are not proxied. Service endpoints are
`/health/live`, `/health/ready`, and `/metrics`.

Hosted administrative writes append tenant-local chained audit rows after
control-plane migration 003. The HTTP API does not present the hash chain as
simulation truth or external non-repudiation; authorized operators verify one
tenant's ordered rows and retain chain heads separately. See the
[operator runbook](operator-runbook.md#hosted-audit-chain).

The remaining unprefixed routes in this document describe local mode. Local
mode has no authentication; do not put it behind a public proxy.

## Run control

| Method | Path | Input/result |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/run/start` | Optional `max_ticks` query; starts or resumes |
| `POST` | `/api/run/pause` | Requests an interruptible clean pause |
| `POST` | `/api/run/step` | Executes one tick and returns its summary |
| `POST` | `/api/run/stop` | Finishes, checkpoints, and generates a report |
| `POST` | `/api/run/speed` | JSON `{"delay_s": 0.5}`; `delay_s` must be finite and between 0 and 3600 seconds, otherwise HTTP 422 |
| `GET` | `/api/run/status` | Run, phase, governor, readiness, cooldown, and report state |
| `GET` | `/api/acceptance/status` | Gate results, progress, spend projection, exact Oracle checkpoint schedule, and shock evidence; a run/tick-matched final receipt supplies attachment-backed completed gates |

Halted worlds reject mutating controls. Starting an already-running world returns
its current state rather than creating another task.

## Participant sandbox

These routes return HTTP 403 unless `participant_mode.enabled` is true. Control
changes require a paused, completed-day boundary and an `expected_tick` matching
the current completed tick.

| Method | Path | Input/result |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/participant` | Current lease, next tick, queued command, role-scoped action catalogue, and last execution result |
| `GET` | `/api/participant/history?agent_id=4&limit=50&before_id=120` | Newest-first durable action history with an optional exclusive cursor; returns at most 100 records and `next_before_id` |
| `POST` | `/api/participant/control` | JSON `{"agent_id": 4, "expected_tick": 0}`; controls one living citizen |
| `POST` | `/api/participant/action` | JSON with `expected_tick`, an action from the returned catalogue, and optional `reasoning` |
| `POST` | `/api/participant/release` | JSON `{"expected_tick": 3}`; releases control and cancels the next queued command |

While a citizen is controlled, continuous `/api/run/start` is disabled and
`/api/run/step` requires one queued action for the next day. Commands use the
normal deterministic validator and ledger. Participant influence is persisted
and makes the run ineligible for observer-only acceptance evidence.
The citizen inspector loads this history on demand and can page backward without
adding it to the observatory's frequent polling payload.

## World queries

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/metrics?names=...` | Named time series; includes output, labor income, CPI, inflation, labor, market, and distribution metrics |
| `GET` | `/api/agents` | Identity, status, and execution list; add `limit` (1–200), `after_id`, `q`, or `population_tier=core|periphery` for a bounded cursor page |
| `GET` | `/api/agents/{id}` | Persona, accounts, loans, bounded beliefs and history, memories, holdings, decision audit, current compute plan/route, skills, XP, and progression/subscription history |
| `GET` | `/api/banks` | Operator ground-truth balance sheets and trust |
| `GET` | `/api/firms` | Sector, status, inventory, price, workers, cash, and stock price |
| `GET` | `/api/institutions` | Government, VC, healthcare, and outlets |
| `GET` | `/api/news?limit=30` | Latest articles |
| `GET` | `/api/conversations?limit=20&q=bank&agent_id=12&tick_from=1&tick_to=30&before_id=90` | Conversations, topics, participants, and messages; bounded literal text/topic/speaker search with optional agent, tick-range, and cursor filters |
| `GET` | `/api/events?limit=80&min_importance=0` | Recent append-only event spine |
| `GET` | `/api/trades?limit=50` | Latest executed exchange trades |
| `GET` | `/api/cost` | Governor plus model/purpose/agent cost breakdown |
| `GET` | `/api/llm/runtime` | Global/provider capacity plus ephemeral public-safe per-agent `queued|thinking` activity (`activity_revision`, agent id, active-call count, tick, elapsed time); also peaks, p50/p95 queue/response/day latency, cooldowns, failures, rate limits, and fallbacks. No prompts, response bodies, reasoning, cache keys, or raw errors are returned. |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/datasets` | Verified manifests/targets plus the latest R21 source and calibrated-versus-synthetic distance summary |

Default macro metrics include `gdp_proxy` (daily final-goods sales),
`gdp_proxy_30d`, `labor_income`, `cpi`, `inflation_30d`, true `cpi_yoy` after
tick 365, unemployment, index, policy rate, money supply, Gini, and sentiment.

### Historical-safe observer projections

These read-only endpoints return the canonical envelope and accept `tick` plus
`fork_id`. List endpoints use bounded `after`/`limit` pagination.

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v2/workspaces/living-agents` | `agent_id`, `project_kind`, and `status` filters; committed, runtime-live-only, and derived evidence remain labelled |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/agents/{agent_id}/journey` | Historical profile, current-at-tick state, milestones, public outputs, and safe evidence references |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/construction-projects` | Semantics-13 projects; filter by `project_kind=private_home|workplace|public_facility` and exact lifecycle `status` |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/construction-projects/{project_id}` | One exact public project or privacy-safe aggregate, plus contribution-type totals where authorized |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/world-map?layers=construction_projects` | Construction layer separate from usable `places`; supports stable project selection in Live City |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/world-map?layers=households,institutions&tick=N` | Historical core household membership/child needs and public bank status, bound to the map envelope; no private accounts or exact household residences. See the [lens contract](plans/2026-09-07-city-society-lenses.md). |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/city/conversations?tick=3&fork_id=...&limit=60` | `city.conversations` envelope for the exact recorded day; ordinary small-talk transcripts, never private communication or provider stores |

City conversations return `data.items`, `tick`, `source=recorded_small_talk`,
`has_more` and `content_truncated`. The default is the newest 60 conversations
(maximum 200), each with up to 64 messages, 4,000 characters per message and
512 topic characters. Per-item/message truncation flags preserve this boundary.
Future conversations, messages and participants are withheld; malformed
participant records are excluded. A wrong fork or unavailable tick returns 409.
The endpoint performs no scientific writes. The city checks its envelope against
the already displayed map before releasing any words. See the
[city observer contract](research/city-observer.md).

Peripheral private-home construction is aggregated by region, status, and
stage. Owner, contributor, permit, exact-site, place, and reversible evidence
links are omitted from those aggregates.

Living Agents and observer events use one semantic activity-card projection.
Cards expose a bounded verb, object, outcome, lifecycle/stage, salience, and
safe `kind`/`id`/`tick` references. Unknown kinds use a labelled generic
fallback and never copy raw event payloads. Runtime `queued`/`thinking`
presence may be included only for a current view; a historical `tick` request
drops current runtime telemetry.

## City observation bookmarks

Local city navigation bookmarks use a separate operator workspace:

| Method | Path | Input/notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/v2/operator/city-observations?context=<JSON>` | Exact map run/fork/visibility/version context; returns context, optimistic version and up to 20 navigation strings |
| `PUT` | `/api/v2/operator/city-observations` | Context, `expected_version`, entries and operator-session CSRF header; atomic save, 409 on stale context/version; no world writes |

Both routes return 404 in hosted-safe mode. See the
[city workspace contract](plans/2026-09-07-city-workspace-navigation.md) for the
field allowlist, context schema, local identity and error handling.

## Oracle and calibration

| Method | Path | Input/notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/oracle/ask` | JSON `{"question":"What is the probability of a bank run within 30 ticks?"}` |
| `GET` | `/api/oracle/predictions` | Predictions plus current scorecard |
| `GET` | `/api/oracle/calibration?scope=run` | Current run; use `scope=all` for pooled stored runs |

Oracle answers are read-only and contain probability, drivers, confidence,
machine-checkable resolution rule, deadline, bounded evidence, and later Brier
score when resolvable.

## Shocks

`GET /api/shocks` returns supported kinds, trigger types, and scheduled shocks.

`POST /api/shocks` accepts:

```json
{
  "kind": "rumor",
  "trigger_type": "shock",
  "trigger": {"tick": 15},
  "duration_ticks": 0,
  "params": {
    "bank_selector": "largest_by_deposits",
    "audience": "current_depositors",
    "n_agents": 40
  },
  "label": "largest-bank rumor"
}
```

Kinds: `policy_rate`, `policy_rule_change`, `oil`, `rumor`, `slant`, `scandal`,
`epidemic`. Triggers: `shock`, `trend`, `conditional`. Empty trigger schedules
the next tick. Unknown kinds return HTTP 400; halted runs return HTTP 409.
Trigger and parameter fields are type-checked when the shock is scheduled
(integer ticks and ids, finite numbers, known `op`, `bank_selector`, and
`audience` values): a malformed field returns HTTP 400 with the reason instead
of failing later inside every NIGHT_CLOSE and wedging the run.

## Reports and replay viewer

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/api/report` | Generates/reuses a report at a completed tick boundary and returns its filesystem path plus served `/reports/...` URL in local mode; returns `409` while Run or a partial tick is active |
| `GET` | `/api/replay/runs` | Lists stored runs |
| `GET` | `/api/replay/{run_id}/summary` | Stored run summary |
| `GET` | `/api/replay/{run_id}/metrics` | Stored metrics; optional `names` |
| `GET` | `/api/replay/{run_id}/tick/{tick}` | Events/state view for one tick |

Generated reports are served from the configured `report_dir` under `/reports/`.
The replay viewer is read-only;
`python run.py --replay RUN_ID` is the separate exact engine re-execution proof.

## External Agent Gateway

Semantics 9 and later expose one scoped boundary for owner-hosted agents. The
generated contract is available at `/api/v2/openapi.json` and checked in at
[`openapi/agent-economy-v2.json`](../openapi/agent-economy-v2.json).

| Method | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET`, `POST` | `/mcp` | Remote Streamable HTTP MCP; bearer OAuth or scoped PAT |
| `POST` | `/oauth/register` | Dynamic registration for public PKCE clients |
| `GET` | `/oauth/authorize` | Human consent and owned-connection selection |
| `POST` | `/oauth/token`, `/oauth/revoke` | Resource-bound token rotation and revocation |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/agent/me`, `/api/v2/agent/turn`, `/api/v2/agent/events` | Identity, long-poll turn mailbox, and cursor events |
| `POST` | `/api/v2/agent/actions` | Idempotent action submission for the exact target tick and projection hash |
| `GET` | `/api/v2/agent/actions/{submission_id}` | Persisted action receipt |
| `GET`, `POST` | `/api/v2/agent/commons` | Scope-filtered Commons read/write adapter |
| `GET`, `POST` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant_id}/agent-connections` | Human owner/admin connection control plane |
| `POST` | `/api/v2/tenants/{tenant_id}/agent-connections/{id}/credentials` | One-time PAT rotation or revocation |

Hosted connection creation requires a run whose gateway is enabled on engine
semantics 9 or later. The default compatible choice is
`world-os-external` (semantics 10). A preserved semantics-7 run returns HTTP
409 with `detail.code = semantics_not_enabled`; a newer profile with the gateway
disabled returns HTTP 409 with `detail.code = gateway_disabled`. These are
configuration conflicts, not service outages, and no catalog connection or
credential is created.

See the [gateway contract](world-os/EXTERNAL-AGENT-GATEWAY.md) and
[client quickstart](../clients/README.md) for the turn and receipt protocol.
`GET /api/v2/agent/turn` and `ae_world_observe` require the `world.read` scope;
the `commons` tier, which is defined without it, reads Commons content only. A
turn always targets the next tick on which the connection is due: the next wake
tick under its `wake_interval_ticks`, never a tick whose decision mailbox has
already closed because it is in progress.
World observations and Commons content are untrusted data; these endpoints never
return private messages, prompts, chain-of-thought, provider payloads, or owner
identity.
The hosted REST proxy accepts only the routes and methods listed above (including
a UUID-shaped action receipt id). Encoded parent segments, alternate internal
paths, and unlisted methods return `404 not_found` before proxying.

The run server also provides three opt-in [Jev advice endpoints](jev-domains.md#helper-apis-scopes-and-accounting):
`POST /api/v2/agent/jev-advice`, `GET /api/v2/agent/commons/jev-view` and
`POST /api/v2/agent/commons/jev-advice`. Their MCP names are `ae_jev_recommend`,
`ae_commons_jev_view` and `ae_commons_jev_recommend`. They require the v4 service
flags and actor scopes, preserve the caller's final submission and return
`submitted: false`. The hosted REST proxy allowlist is not expanded by this
implementation; use the scoped run-server boundary for these advice routes.

When a run explicitly selects Semantics 14, every due first-class external
actor also receives immutable attendance evidence in the run database.
Attendance distinguishes an authored submission, including submitted
`do_nothing`, from a missed turn that applied `safe_do_nothing_v1`. It does
not add a public mutation endpoint and does not replace the turn, submission,
receipt, event, or ledger contracts. See the
[Semantics 14 guide](semantics14-external-turn-attendance.md).

## WebSocket

Connect to `/ws`. The server sends current state on connection and a payload
after each completed tick containing run state, governor state, latest macro
values, and tick summary. Clients may send keepalive text; controls use REST.

## PowerShell examples

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/run/status
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/acceptance/status
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/run/step
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -ContentType application/json `
  -Body '{"question":"Will any bank fail within 30 ticks?"}' `
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/oracle/ask
```

## City 3D and construction

`GET /api/v2/world-map?tick=live&population=all` supplies authorized city layers.
The optional `banks` layer returns public `id`, `name`, `region_id` and as-of
`status`, without accounts or balances. Citizens are filtered by arrival and
death at the requested tick. Place and presence privacy restrictions still apply.

`GET /api/v2/urban-development?tick=live` returns the standard scoped envelope
with public catalog quotes, parcels and lifecycle projects. Numeric completed
ticks and `fork_id` scope work like other projections. It never exposes escrow
accounts, private balances or request keys, and performs no writes.

With the semantics13 profile enabled, the participant action catalog includes
`construct_building`, `cancel_construction` and `demolish_building`. Submit them
through `/api/participant/action`; a queued command is not a completed building.
Quotes and placement validation are server-owned. See the
[construction contract](urban-development.md) for exact fields, authority and
refund rules. Reading the participant catalog does not update agent memories;
native decision execution continues to record memory access normally.
