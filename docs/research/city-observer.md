# City observation and price inspection

The City workspace connects Atlas, List, experimental 3D and recorded-day playback to
one evidence inspector and the Price Discovery Lab. It observes simulation state
without changing it; saved navigation belongs to the separate operator workspace.
City now opens `/runs/:runId/world`; existing `/live-city` links redirect to its
recorded-day view while preserving the observation context. Progress and
remaining work are tracked in the [execution log](../plans/2026-09-06-research-city-execution.md).

## City is the local home

Local `/`, `/observatory` and `/runs/:runId/overview` resolve to City. Pulse
and the workspace rail have been removed from local navigation. Existing dossier
URLs still work: People, Businesses & banks, Markets, Law & civic life,
Conversations & news, Economy and Evidence open as contextual City panels.
**Back to City** or Escape restores selection, renderer, filters, camera and day.
Tools contains research, reports, replay, forecasts, diagnostics and public Commons;
agent onboarding remains under Connections. Hosted account/run screens retain
their existing workflow.

**What agents did** reads the whole selected committed day, with 40-event pages,
agent/category filters and totals independent of the visible page. Atlas, List
and 3D use the same selected day and activity markers. Proposed, queued and
scheduled events are pending; a request is not a completed economic outcome.
Construction and travel starts remain pending until their recorded completion.
Firm activity rows can select the named business directly, without inventing
an individual actor when the source event identifies only the firm.
Unknown events remain neutral recorded headers without raw payloads.
**Inspect this day** freezes the observation while the simulation advances.
Native scripted activity is visible even with zero external-agent or LLM calls.

Economy preserves current balance sheets and economic charts. These current-only
operator summaries are explicitly unavailable at historical ticks. News and
public conversations use their recorded day; authorized communication threads
remain a separate disclosure. Provider diagnostics and Regions & settlements
are collapsed below the primary map/activity area. One simulation clock in the
header controls the live local run; historical views are read-only.

Experimental 3D uses the common keyboard explorer and evidence lens, with focus,
pan, rotation and zoom. Its camera position, target and zoom persist in the
observer URL and saved observations. Atlas and 3D keep separate camera poses
when switching views. Manual 3D camera changes stop following a person.
Missing recorded locations are labelled display slots.
A run without presence cannot acquire recorded journeys by changing renderer.
Recorded day is offered only when presence exists. Construction capability is
explicit: use a fresh `runs/simcity.yaml` world to exercise permitted company
construction, escrow and completion; old profiles are not silently upgraded.
2.5D Diorama bookmarks remain readable for compatibility, but that duplicate
renderer is no longer in the main view selector.

The construction acceptance check uses the disposable provider-free SimCity
fixture from `test_http_participant_catalog_wait_release_and_exact_replay`.
Its public UI showed project 1 building at day 13 (event 2409, 50,000 cents
committed, due day 16), then completed at day 16 (event 2964, workplace 40).
Construction evidence opened in the common City panel and returned to the same
business, renderer, filters and historical day. The source fixture also passes
exact recorded replay; no original user world is upgraded by this check.

## Inspect a business

1. Open City at the desired run, fork and tick.
2. Click a business in Atlas, or select it in **Keyboard explorer**. The same
   selector reaches people, public places and construction records in every view.
3. Use **Focus selection**, zoom or the four pan buttons in Atlas or Diorama.
   Drag the Atlas background or the Diorama field with a mouse to pan.
   Selection and camera remain in the URL when switching renderers.
4. Choose **Inspect goods and equity prices**. Both domains use the same business
   and observation window. The lab distinguishes offers, executions, quantities,
   no-trade periods and unlisted equity; a missing price stays missing.
5. **Explore the city** restores the city renderer, camera and filters. Changing
   the business in the lab selects that business on return. Browser Back also
   restores prior discrete selections and camera commands.

An employee's lens offers **Inspect employer** when its business is present in
the map projection. A projected business workplace and its owner link to each
other. Missing employee counts or workplaces are labelled unavailable; the map
does not read private balances or infer undisclosed employment.

On a narrow screen, **Open selected evidence** moves from Diorama to the
inspector. Optional agent search, activity filters and layers live under
**Layers and agent filters**. A URL with an active agent search/filter opens
that panel initially. Atlas remains available when WebGL cannot start.

## List and saved observations

The **List** view provides public-object search and 40-row pages using the same
selection. On mobile, activating a list item opens and focuses the shared evidence
sheet. Breadcrumbs connect a person to their visible household and a business to
its recorded workplace. **Save observation** and **Save event bookmark** persist
the numeric tick, selection, filters and camera in the local operator workspace;
they do not copy evidence bodies. See the
[layout and bookmark contract](../plans/2026-09-07-city-workspace-navigation.md)
for capacity, reload and concurrent-edit behavior.

## Follow a person

Select a person in the keyboard explorer or on the map, then choose **Follow
person**. Atlas and Diorama center that person's public position from the
selected frame. Recorded day centers their animated chip, including its disclosed
de-collision offset, on the independent playback clock. Camera movement never
changes a placement, a simulation tick or a research artifact.

Follow keeps one explicit person ID across renderer switches, reloads, filters
and tick changes. It pauses when that person is absent, no longer alive, hidden
by filters, or lacks a public position. No other person becomes the target;
returning to a frame/filter with a public position resumes following. The paused
camera uses the saved manual bookmark, not a position cached from another tick.
Atlas's derived district placement alone cannot activate follow. Recorded day
requires authorized individual placement history, even when the roster contains
additional peripheral residents.

Zoom keeps follow active. **Stop following** saves the current camera; manual
pan, Reset camera, Focus selection, or selecting a different object stops follow.
Touch screens retain vertical page scrolling and expose the same pan/zoom actions
as buttons. Keyboard explorer reaches every public object even when marks overlap.
At a business/workplace overlap, the business receives the map click and its
inspector links to the workplace. Construction labels appear on selection, hover
or keyboard focus; Atlas symbols and labels retain readable sizes under zoom.

## Observation context

The city loads its map first, then pins civic summary and event/summary reads
to that map's actual tick and fork. Run, tick, fork, projection name, semantics,
policy and visibility-key checks must pass before releasing the combined frame.
A failed or mismatched frame withholds the cached marks. The requested map
layers include construction projects and flows as well as agents and places.

Current provider activity has separate run/fork context and a `private, no-store`
response. Historical city views neither request it nor display cached activity.
Terminal runs and failed telemetry refreshes withhold cached active indicators.
Queued/thinking marks remain ephemeral telemetry, distinct from settled events.
The runtime read itself makes no scientific database writes.

## Watch a recorded day

![Recorded-day playback and the shared person inspector; only authorized individual placements are drawn](assets/city-recorded-day.png)

Choose **Recorded day**, then **Play recorded day**. Playback starts paused;
Pause, Restart and the 0.5×/1×/2×/4× speeds affect only presentation time. Speed
changes accumulate elapsed time before changing pace, so they do not jump along
the day. Changing the displayed frame or agent filters resets playback to paused.
In a live observation, **Pin this day** freezes the observation tick; otherwise
a newly committed day replaces the frame and pauses playback.

The renderer consumes the same validated map as Atlas and Diorama and performs
no data requests. Agent filters and the keyboard explorer share selection with
the inspector. Click a person to highlight their recorded placements throughout
playback; Escape releases that highlight while retaining inspector selection.
This local highlight is separate from **Follow person**; Escape does not change
the URL's camera-follow identity. Use Stop following to release the camera.
Switching renderers preserves URL selection but restarts the playback clock.
Businesses, places and projects remain inspectable through the common selector;
this renderer draws recorded people and places, not Diorama's building geometry.

Movement between placements is interpolated. Missing placements, anonymous
licensing-office occupancy and peripheral privacy keep their existing rules.
The placement-coverage line compares drawn people with the current visible
roster. A large roster does not authorize drawing withheld peripheral presence;
missing individual records stay absent even with Everyone selected.
The clock cannot create journeys or advance the economy. Reduced motion steps
between placements instead of gliding. A profile without presence records has
an explicit unavailable state and a disabled Play control. On mobile, **Open
selected evidence** reaches the inspector without needing to chase a marker.

Conversations use a separate, optional `city.conversations` envelope pinned to
the map's actual run, fork, tick and visibility. A failed or mismatched response
withholds words while leaving valid map placements usable. Only the ordinary
recorded small-talk tables are read. Conversations whose speakers are not both
present at the same recorded evening address are not positioned on the map.
The exact time within the evening is unrecorded. Response and transcript limits
are disclosed, as are bubbles omitted for lack of screen space.

Recorded-day playback requests no current provider telemetry and shows no
runtime activity. Historical workspace pages also open no live projection socket.

## URL and renderer contracts

- `view=atlas|diorama|recorded` selects a renderer. The legacy `/live-city` alias
  selects `recorded` and defaults to `population=all` if no population was given.
- `firm` is a positive integer, mutually exclusive with `agent`, `place` and
  `project`. Validation against the selected map precedes use. Existing agent,
  place and aggregate-project URLs remain supported.
- `camera=x,y,zoom` stores only bounded display coordinates: x/y 0–100 and zoom
  1.8–5.4. Default camera values are omitted. All three renderers read this
  bookmark; their framing differs. Atlas scales its city plane relative to zoom
  3.05, Diorama keeps its fixed orientation, and recorded day fits its recorded
  geography at reset. Numeric bookmarks cannot add arbitrary renderer properties.
- `follow` is a positive person ID. It implies selection of that person; an
  explicitly conflicting object/agent selection discards follow. Movement updates
  the camera locally without producing a URL/history entry per frame or tick.
- Camera buttons create history entries. An Atlas drag creates one entry and
  replaces it during movement; Diorama pointer changes replace the current entry.
  Switching renderers retains camera/follow state; recorded playback itself still
  restarts paused. A zoomed/following recording hides the auxiliary detail inset
  because its original empty-space placement is no longer valid.
- Evidence links carry a bounded `city` return hint for renderer, selection,
  filters, camera and follow. Destination workspaces retain their own `view` parameter.
  Returning admits only known display fields; the destination's current run,
  fork and tick always take precedence over values inside the hint. It is never
  an external redirect or an economic command.

Building heights, district shapes and interpolated positions are visual
encodings, not canonical geometry. A firm's location distinguishes its recorded
workplace, a regional anchor and a derived district placement. Construction
geometry still uses stored work; dense projects show their text when selected
and retain their inspector and keyboard entries. The scene footer explains its
encodings without covering the frame-status labels.

## Verification scope

Browser regressions cover mismatched frames, historical request suppression,
foreign runtime, terminal cached activity, camera reload/history, workplace
links, absent/hidden/dead follow targets, recorded follow geometry and the
city → prices → city workflow. Unit checks cover bounded URL
parsing and rejection of cross-scope return hints. Production smoke inspection
uses an isolated 300-resident paused world and no provider calls.

These checks establish UI/data-contract behavior. They do not establish that
the economic model matches empirical markets or that the full city/society
roadmap is complete.
