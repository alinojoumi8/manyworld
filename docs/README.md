# Manyworld handbook

The root [README](../README.md) is the friendly project entry point. This
handbook separates user, operator, researcher, developer, and audit material so
each audience can find the authoritative level of detail.

## Learn and run

- [Getting started](getting-started.md) — install, first offline run, experiment,
  optional live routes, resume, replay, and verification.
- [Civic Atlas dashboard](civic-atlas.md) — every product and workspace menu,
  shareable URL state, World Pulse, evidence tools, historical boundaries,
  accessibility, and mocked/real-backend verification.
- [Research guide and use cases](research-guide.md) — causal model, experiment
  discipline, metrics, Oracle evidence, and interpretation limits.
- [Model description](research/model-description.md) — entities, scheduling,
  mechanism assumptions, input provenance, measurement contracts and limits.
- [Price Discovery Lab](research/price-lab.md) — historical inspector, goods/equity observations,
  strict study drafts, provider-free pilots, replay receipts and findings.
- [Policy studies in the operator workspace](plans/2026-09-07-policy-operator-workflow.md) — private model designs,
  reviewed inference allowances, model draws, pause/resume and price evidence.
- [Persistent people and household needs](semantics15-households.md) — version-15
  births, age, membership, care gaps, child demand, census and replay boundaries.
- [Daily random keys](semantics16-randomness.md) — version-16 mechanism/day/origin
  streams, explicit research declarations and goods/equity pilot limits.
- [Configuration and providers](configuration.md) — profiles, inheritance,
  information boundaries, beliefs, routing, budget, and shock targeting.
- [Jev bounded decisions](jev.md) — OpenRouter key setup, offline/live/hybrid
  pilots, private receipts, exact replay and prospective comparison commands.
- [Jev domain delegation](jev-domains.md) — opt-in v4 economic/civic menus,
  recorded voting, authenticated helpers, budgets and evaluation boundaries.
- [Local and hosted API reference](api-reference.md) — REST, WebSocket,
  tenant/auth/run routes, request shapes, and PowerShell examples.

- [City 3D guide](../city/README.md) — Blender assets, the provider-free city, citizen control and construction.
- [Construction contract](urban-development.md) — semantics13 authority, ledger escrow, lifecycle and replay.

## Operate and recover

- [Operator runbook](operator-runbook.md) — safe startup, hosted deployment,
  backup/restore, bounded pilot, production acceptance, phase-aware resume,
  reports, replay, and retention.
- [Controlled Hermes/Jev diagnostics](hermes-diagnostics.md) — read-only checks,
  explicit single decisions and guarded single-tick validation.
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) — provider cooldowns, orphaned state,
  legacy databases, dashboard performance, evidence failures, and replay.
- [Security policy](../SECURITY.md) — local/hosted boundaries, RLS/auth threat
  model, credentials, run-data sensitivity, and vulnerability reporting.

## Build and understand

- [Architecture](architecture.md) — deterministic ownership, tick phases,
  packages, information model, persistence, and runtime boundaries.
- [Buzz-derived architecture boundaries](buzz-derived-architecture.md) — shared
  activity projection, external attendance, proposal-only Builder support, and
  hosted audit chaining.
- [Development and testing](development.md) — setup, test layers, safe behavior
  changes, compatibility, logs, and CI.
- [UI menu hardening ledger](plans/2026-08-30-ui-menu-hardening.md) — complete
  workspace inventory, acceptance contract, and current verification evidence.
- [Full-stack review remediation ledger](plans/2026-09-01-full-stack-review-remediation.md) —
  the 2026-09-01 backend and dashboard review: what was fixed, how it was
  verified, and the design decisions deliberately deferred.
- [Research city review and roadmap](plans/2026-09-06-research-city-roadmap.md) —
  proposed economic-research and interactive-city direction, with equal priority
  for everyday prices and financial assets; links to the dated source review
  and implementation specifications. The linked execution log separates
  implemented foundations from pending packages.
- [Branch lifecycle and consolidation](branch-lifecycle.md) — protect active
  work, classify refs, port divergent commits, and gate deletion.
- [Documentation maintenance](documentation-maintenance.md) — source-of-truth
  hierarchy, update matrix, writing rules, and verification.
- [Architecture decision records](adr/README.md) — accepted implementation
  boundaries and clearly labelled proposed direction.
- [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) — contributor contract and PR evidence.
- [Technical specification](../TECH-SPEC.md) — normative implementation design.

## Product and evidence

- [Product requirements](../PRD.md)
- [Delivery tasks](../TASKS.md)
- [Implementation status](implementation-status.md) — the single maintained
  release-status ledger
- [Local reproducibility release profile](reproducibility-release-profile.md) —
  fixed offline gates and the boundary with strict production evidence
- [Release-readiness go/no-go sheet](release-readiness-go-no-go.md) — current
  decision state, required proof, sequencing, spend, and authorization boundaries
- [Historical printable status snapshot](implementation-status.html)
- [Emergent phenomena](emergent-phenomena.md)
- [Live provider validation](live-provider-validation.md)
- [Diagnostic live run `f7c6238bf5`](live-run-f7c6238bf5.md)
- [Closed PR #10 reconciliation](pr-10-reconciliation.md)

## World OS expansion

These documents define the Semantics 8 communications lake, Semantics 9
External Agent Gateway, Semantics 10 Agent Commons, Semantics 11 compute
economy, Semantics 12 civic permits, the separately approved Semantics 13
construction economy, and Semantics 14 external-turn attendance. Their code is implemented, but
their release states differ: Semantics 8 is the released deterministic causal
baseline; Semantics 9–10 remain rollout-gated; Semantics 11–14 are implemented
opt-in contracts whose public use inherits those hosted gates. The
[implementation-status ledger](implementation-status.md) is authoritative for
current labels. Historical release contracts and receipts remain frozen.

The World OS `PRD.md` and `TECH-SPEC.md` are **successor specifications, not
copies** of the same-named files at the repository root. They differ
deliberately: the root pair defines the maintained runtime contract, this pair
defines successor direction, and the implementation-status ledger records what
is implemented, released, or rollout-gated. Do not reconcile the specification
pairs into one file.

Connector assets live in the [Python and TypeScript clients](../clients/README.md),
the [portable connection skill](../integrations/connect-agent-economy/SKILL.md),
the Hermes and OpenClaw presets under `integrations/`, and the generated
[OpenAPI contract](../openapi/agent-economy-v2.json).

Generated run reports and acceptance receipts live under `reports/out/`. They
are run-specific evidence, not maintained documentation. The PRD and technical
specification outrank generated narratives when a conflict exists.
