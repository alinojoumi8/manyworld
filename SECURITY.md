# Security policy

## Supported surfaces

Local mode remains a single-operator research observatory with no
authentication, authorization, tenant isolation, or CSRF protection. Bind
`run.py --serve` and the Vite development server to `127.0.0.1`; never expose
either directly to an untrusted network.

R22 adds a separately enabled hosted service. Its security boundary is:

- invitation-only registration with scrypt password hashes and opaque 256-bit
  session/invitation tokens stored only as hashes;
- tenant memberships with read-only `observer` and controlling `admin` roles;
- PostgreSQL row-level security enabled and forced on tenant-bearing tables,
  with separate web and supervisor roles provisioned `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS`,
  default-deny access outside a transaction-scoped tenant context, and run
  discovery granted only to the supervisor role;
- secure same-site `__Host-ae_session` cookies, CSRF checks on mutations,
  authentication throttling, cross-tenant 404 responses, redacted audit events,
  tenant-local chained audit rows after migration 003, and restrictive HTTP
  security headers;
- one schema-v11 SQLite world per run, one active writer lease per run, and
  immutable checksummed local/S3-compatible snapshots;
- a non-root read-only application container behind Caddy TLS, with PostgreSQL,
  MinIO, and Prometheus on an internal network.
- a MinIO root identity restricted to bootstrap and a separate bucket/prefix-
  scoped runtime identity that can write/read snapshots but cannot delete them.

The local and hosted servers are distinct entry points. Hosted mode does not
turn the unauthenticated local API into an internet-safe service.

The [Hostinger alternative](docs/hostinger-vps.md) uses filesystem recovery
snapshots and SFTP replication instead of MinIO. Separate SSH identities give
the app read-only run recovery, Litestream run replication, and the catalog
backup service access to its own chroot. The catalog reader uses a non-superuser
role with read access across tenant RLS policies. SSH keys and the pinned server
host key are operator configuration. Archives and replicas
contain full private memory/model/history data; compression is not encryption
or redaction. Protect and encrypt the storage volumes on both servers. Restoring
an older PostgreSQL catalog can restore old sessions or grants, so reconcile
revocations before reopening access. Hosted storage admission rejects new run
writes at configured capacity with a path-free `507` response while preserving
reads and pause/stop controls.

External APIs accept only personal and access credentials as bearer tokens;
refresh tokens work only at the OAuth token endpoint. Hosted agent writes verify
credentials before scanning storage, and revalidate after admission before
mutating credential state. Every hosted HTTP method has the same 64 KiB body
limit, including GET requests that pass through the agent proxy.
Rate-limit denials add at most one audit row per connection/minute; rejected
traffic does not create an unbounded audit trail in a paused run.

Anonymous OAuth client registration permits 20 requests per observed peer and
300 total per hour, per server process. Forwarded headers supplied directly by
clients do not change the limiter's peer. A proxy or shared NAT can group clients;
configure trusted proxy addresses at the deployment boundary before relying on
distinct peer limits. PostgreSQL registration is also serialized and capped at
10,000 stored client records across processes; the local SQLite service has the
same cap. Existing clients and agent memory remain intact when registration is
refused. New registrations return 429 with `Retry-After` for the ingress limit
or 503 at persistent capacity. Operators must review unused client metadata or
adjust the reviewed capacity before increasing this ceiling.

The [September storage and hosted security review](docs/security-review-2026-09-07.md)
records reproduced issues, fixes, validation and remaining deployment checks.

## Hosted threat model and operator obligations

The implemented boundary addresses ordinary cross-tenant reads/writes, stolen
CSRF-free browser requests, credential guessing, duplicate run writers,
path traversal, mutable snapshot replacement, and secret leakage through error
or audit payloads. It assumes the host, PostgreSQL administrator, object-store
administrator, deployment environment, and TLS termination are trusted.

Before any public deployment:

- use a managed secret store or protected environment injection and rotate all
  bootstrap/database/object-store credentials;
- for an existing reference PostgreSQL volume, use the profile-gated
  `rotate-database-passwords` job in the operator runbook; editing `.env` alone
  does not alter stored role passwords;
- keep the migration DSN out of the application container at runtime and verify
  the application login is not superuser and cannot bypass RLS;
- terminate TLS at Caddy or an equivalent trusted proxy, set the exact public
  base URL, restrict database/object-store ports to the private network, and
  configure durable encrypted volumes plus retention;
- exercise snapshot verification and restore, review audit retention and access,
  set external rate limits/alerting, and record a multi-user load/isolation test;
- patch base images and dependencies, rerun secrets/dependency/license scans,
  and complete the hosted acceptance/CI gate.

The repository supplies a reference Compose deployment, not a claim of public
production certification or protection against a malicious infrastructure
administrator.

The hosted load probe accepts credentials only through environment-variable
names in repeated `--user TENANT_UUID,EMAIL,PASSWORD_ENV[,RUN_UUID]` arguments.
Use scoped test identities, remove those environment variables immediately
afterward, and protect the receipt as operational evidence. The emitted JSON is
designed to exclude passwords, cookies, email addresses, response bodies, and
provider data. HTTPS is mandatory. `--allow-insecure-loopback` may be used only
for local HTTPS smoke with a development certificate; never use it against a
remote host or as a reason to expose the local unauthenticated server.

## Audit and proposal boundaries

The hosted audit chain is tamper-evident within each tenant. Verification checks
sequence continuity, prior-hash linkage, canonical content hashes, and tenant
isolation. Rows created before migration 003 remain unchained legacy records.
The chain does not by itself detect tail truncation, so operators must retain
the latest sequence/hash separately. It is not externally anchored and does not
provide non-repudiation against an administrator who can replace both the
database and every retained head. Follow the
[operator verification procedure](docs/operator-runbook.md#hosted-audit-chain).

The proposal-only Builder sink accepts only `proposal.create`, allowlisted
paths, and fixed validation evidence, then writes an immutable tenant-scoped
artifact. It has no Git, merge, deployment, network, credential, engine,
ledger, replay, or `ActionExecutor` authority. A proposal receipt is not
approval and must never be treated as executable content. The repository does
not currently expose a Civic Builder runtime or mandate facade.

Proposal bundles remain untrusted review inputs. Inspect patches without
executing embedded instructions, run validation in an isolated human-controlled
environment, protect tenant identifiers and rationale/evidence, and apply the
ordinary code-review and release process before any later implementation.

## Secrets and sensitive artifacts

- Put provider credentials only in the ignored `.env` file or process
  environment.
- Never add keys to YAML profiles, reports, screenshots, issues, or pull
  requests.
- Treat run databases as potentially sensitive: they can contain prompts,
  model responses, personas, memories, conversations, and decision evidence.
- Operational logging redacts credential-shaped fields, but review artifacts
  before sharing them outside the project.
- Revoke a provider key immediately if it is exposed and remove it from Git
  history rather than only deleting it in a later commit.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report security issues privately to the repository owner through GitHub's
private vulnerability reporting if enabled, or another private channel. Include
reproduction steps, affected commit/profile, impact, and a suggested mitigation.
Do not publish credentials or sensitive run contents in a public issue.

For hosted incidents, revoke the affected session/invitation records, preserve
the redacted audit trail, separately retained audit-chain head, and immutable
snapshots; verify the affected tenant chain; rotate relevant credentials; and
verify tenant scope before restoring service. Never copy a tenant's world
database, prompt corpus, proposal bundle, or audit evidence into a public issue.
