# Design System: Manyworld — Civic Weather Room

## Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Civic Weather Room"**

Manyworld should feel like a daylit municipal observatory built to read a
living city: cool chart paper, powder-coated instrument housings, cadastral ink,
translucent acetate overlays, and saturated signals that mean something
specific. The city is not scenery. It is a spatial index into agents,
institutions, communications, transactions, and their evidence.

The system pairs a large cartographic field with compact operating instruments.
Dense information is organized by survey lines, numbered coordinates,
districts, and evidence transects rather than repeated dashboard cards. Motion
behaves like a scientific display: fronts reform, paths advance, and markers
change state only when underlying data changes.

**Key Characteristics:**

- A cool, daylit field with large navy and cobalt cartographic regions.
- Signal colors reserved for distinct, named data states.
- Survey grids, registration marks, contour lines, and acetate layers.
- A spatial city overview that always leads to inspectable evidence.
- Compact civic typography with highly legible tables and labels.
- Purposeful, synchronized motion with a complete reduced-motion equivalent.

## Colors

The palette uses a Full Palette strategy: cool municipal neutrals carry long
operator sessions, while three saturated inks own whole data roles instead of
appearing as decorative accents.

### Primary

- **Survey Navy** (`#12233F`): primary ink, navigation fields, map depth, and
  high-trust controls.
- **Blueprint Cobalt** (`#2457D6`): selected routes, active evidence links, and
  the current investigative focus.

### Secondary

- **Signal Vermilion** (`#E44732`): alerts, rejected actions, failed invariants,
  and conditions requiring intervention.
- **Field Chartreuse** (`#B7D64A`): verified live work, healthy flows, completed
  settlement, and positive system health.

### Tertiary

- **Instrument Cyan** (`#48AEB0`): communications, provider activity, and
  secondary live movement.

### Neutral

- **Cool Chart Paper** (`#EEF2F0`): the default daylit workspace ground.
- **Porcelain White** (`#FAFCFA`): tables, inspectors, and readable instruments.
- **Slate Ink** (`#263A53`): body copy and dense labels.
- **Survey Gray** (`#586878`): secondary copy and inactive states.
- **Rule Gray** (`#C8D0D3`): measured dividers, grid lines, and registration
  marks.

**The Named Signal Rule.** A saturated color must map to a documented state or
data family. No rainbow decoration and no arbitrary recoloring.

**The Field Ownership Rule.** Color appears in decisive regions, routes, and
marks. It is not scattered as interchangeable accent chips.

## Typography

**Display Font:** Bahnschrift SemiCondensed (with DIN Alternate and Arial Narrow
fallbacks)

**Body Font:** Segoe UI Variable (with Segoe UI and system UI fallbacks)

**Label/Mono Font:** Cascadia Code (with SFMono-Regular and Consolas fallbacks)

**Character:** Condensed civic signage gives workspaces and districts an
institutional voice; the body face remains calm and highly readable; monospaced
type is reserved for coordinates, ticks, identifiers, provider telemetry, and
evidence provenance.

### Hierarchy

- **Display** (620, fluid 2.1–4.5rem, 0.88): the city title and first-surface
  civic statements,
  never routine card headings.
- **Headline** (620, fluid 1.65–2.55rem, 1): workspace and inspector titles.
- **Title** (650, 0.9–1.15rem, 1.2): instruments, agents, firms, and events.
- **Body** (400–520, 0.78–1rem, 1.55): explanations and evidence summaries,
  generally capped near 70 characters per line.
- **Label** (600, 0.62–0.72rem, tracked uppercase): survey coordinates, states,
  field legends, and control labels.

**The Two-Language Rule.** Condensed type names the civic world; mono type
proves its coordinates and provenance. Body text does neither job.

## Layout

The dominant spatial model is a surveyed field plus instruments. On wide
screens the live city owns roughly two thirds of the first viewport and the
evidence/activity instrument owns the remaining third. The navigation is a
stable civic index, not a stack of promotional cards. Secondary workspaces use
wide ledgers, transects, and split views aligned to the same survey grid.

Large surfaces may touch or overlap like chart sheets and acetate layers.
Spacing follows a compact 4px base with 8px controls, 16px instruments, and
24px field changes. The Civic Atlas rail is 252px wide. The live atlas and evidence
lens use a 2.05fr / 0.78fr split with a 650px minimum working height. Dense
sections earn quiet margins; every heading has more space above it than below.

At 980px and below the evidence instrument moves beneath the atlas while the
selection persists. At 760px and below controls become stacked corridors and
the atlas keeps at least 570px of height; at 460px it keeps 520px. On phones the
reading order is district overview, selected agent, current activity, then
evidence. The full city is never shrunk into an illegible thumbnail.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth comes from material stacking: cool paper below, translucent acetate data
layers over the city, and powder-coated instruments above them. Surfaces are
flat and divided by rules; the implemented city, panels, rail, top bar, and
fields use no resting box shadow. Selected agent marks gain concentric rules,
while dialogs may use a backdrop because they genuinely overlay the field.

**The Measured Depth Rule.** If an element cannot move, overlay, or receive
focus, it should not float.

## Shapes

The form language is rectilinear and surveyed. Major fields have square or
subtly eased corners; tabs and legends may use clipped corners inspired by
map-sheet indexing. Circular forms are reserved for agent markers, measured
pressure fields, and status beacons. Decorative pill containers are avoided.

Lines carry hierarchy: hairline survey rules, heavier district boundaries, and
bold active transects. Controls use measured 3px corners, instruments use 8px
corners, and the major city field uses 12px corners. The mast and firm
footprints use clipped survey-plate corners. Shapes should look plotted,
stamped, folded, or mounted, not inflated.

## Components

### Buttons

- **Shape:** Compact plotted controls with 3px corners and a minimum 39px
  primary action height.
- **Primary:** Blueprint Cobalt field with Porcelain White text and 12px
  horizontal padding.
- **Hover / Focus:** Primary darkens to its implemented pressed blue; secondary
  controls move onto a cool-paper field. All controls use the global visible
  cobalt focus ring.
- **Disabled:** Opacity is reduced to 38–45% and the pointer changes to
  not-allowed; controls never disappear while unavailable.

### Fields

- **Style:** White field, Rule Gray stroke, Survey Navy text, 3px corners, and
  compact 8px by 12px internal space.
- **Focus:** The global 2px Blueprint Cobalt outline sits 3px outside the field.
- **Search:** Search can combine with city layers and committed-event filtering;
  the empty state offers a complete reset.

### Navigation

- **Desktop:** A stable Survey Navy civic rail. The selected workspace owns a
  full Field Chartreuse region with Survey Navy icon and copy.
- **Hover / Focus:** Unselected routes gain a quiet white wash; selected routes
  use Vermilion only as the small route indicator.
- **Mobile:** The rail becomes a horizontal workspace index. The brand mark and
  navigation remain visible while captions yield before icons or targets.

### Instrument Panels

- **Shape:** Porcelain White with a 1px Rule Gray boundary and 8px corners.
- **Hierarchy:** Panels are joined by rules and aligned columns, not separated
  into equal promotional cards.
- **States:** Loading, error, empty, selected, stale, historical, and disabled
  states retain their own text treatment; color is always paired with wording.

### City home and evidence panels

City is the only local primary destination. `/`, `/observatory` and the old
`overview` route resolve to it. The map and complete-day activity feed share the
first surface; the feed gives native actions visible outcomes even when there
are no external-agent submissions. The large workspace rail and Pulse briefing
are retired. People, economy, organizations, markets, law, conversations and
evidence open as contextual panels with one Back to City action and keyboard
focus containment. Tools groups research and operator utilities. Connections
groups onboarding and owned agents. Historical views hide current run controls
and current-only balance summaries.

### Civic City

Atlas, List, experimental 3D and capability-gated Recorded day share selection,
filters, observation tick and the evidence lens. Atlas and 3D retain their own
bounded camera positions in the same observer bookmark, including evidence-panel
round trips, browser history and reload. Legacy 2.5D links remain readable
but the redundant toggle is removed. The complete-day feed pages forty cards at
a stable event high-water mark; totals and marker sets do not depend on that page.
Pending requests, completed outcomes, rejections, cancellations and neutral
records have separate text labels. 3D batches markers by outcome for bounded
draw calls. Actual places and presence remain distinct from derived display
slots. No renderer invents traffic or upgrades an old run's simulation profile.

Actor-linked transects end in directional arrowheads. Markers animate only for
real queued or in-flight provider activity; current-tick settlement and
rejection use stable outcome rings. The activity dock and evidence lens pair
every color with readable state text. Runtime activity is explicitly ephemeral
observer telemetry. It never substitutes for the proposal, validation, event,
receipt, or ledger records that settle world state. Runs without coordinates
use deterministic role-based placement and say **Derived civic layout** in both
views and the evidence lens. Historical views resolve roster, place, queue,
flow, and event projections at the requested tick and suppress current runtime
overlays. Arbitrary historical navigation snaps; only evidence-backed live
runtime activity may pulse.

`view=atlas|diorama|recorded`, `agent=<id>`, `firm=<id>`, `place=<id>`, and `project=<id>` are
observer-only, shareable URL state. Agent, firm, place, and project selection are
mutually exclusive.
Peripheral placement stays withheld, and licensing-office presence remains an
aggregate. The Diorama provides a keyboard object explorer and falls back to
the Atlas when WebGL2 or its lazy bundle is unavailable.

WorldMonitor informed the layout grammar—dominant map, compact layers,
coordinated activity, and evidence inspection—but no WorldMonitor source,
assets, or dependencies are imported. Manyworld remains MIT-licensed while
the reference project is AGPL-3.0-or-later.

### People and Living Agents

The primary route is presented as **People** and contains the Living Agents
historical directory, selected journey, and progress streams without adding a
second navigation destination. It consumes only the v2 observer projections
and keeps committed, runtime, and derived evidence visibly distinct. Runtime
state is live-only; historical ticks never inherit it. See the
[Living Agents review and projection contract](docs/living-agents.md).

Semantics-13 construction appears as a separate project layer until work is
complete. Foundation, frame, shell, and completed geometry is derived from
stored work units and labelled with exact numerator/denominator counts. Exact
public/workplace sites are selectable; peripheral private homes are district
aggregates. See the [construction economy contract](docs/semantics13-construction-economy.md).

### Identity Mark

The generated survey emblem is a clipped municipal plate containing the four
signal roles. The live wordmark beside it reads **Civic Atlas**. The image is
rendered from `dashboard/src/assets/world-os-emblem.png`; text remains live HTML
beside it, never rasterized into the asset.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do:

- Follow the [city observer interaction contract](docs/research/city-observer.md)
  for map selection, price inspection, camera bookmarks, persistent person follow
  and historical context. Missing public positions pause follow without changing
  the intended person. Keep camera controls outside the transformed map geometry.

- **Do** let the city or investigative field own the composition.
- **Do** make every live mark keyboard reachable and connect it to a readable
  inspector or table row.
- **Do** distinguish observed, derived, inferred, stale, and synthetic layout
  states in both text and form.
- **Do** use synchronized transitions that reveal a change in world state.
- **Do** keep dense data aligned to stable columns, coordinates, and legends.

- Support an original interactive 2.5D research city: pan, zoom, select, follow,
  inspect, time travel, and compare declared interventions. Recorded-day
  playback has its own clock and controls; animation cannot advance the world.
  Preserve evidence labels, keyboard access, and authorized projections.

### Don't:
- **Don't** add reward loops, invented economic events, or decorative agent
  activity that could be mistaken for recorded behavior.
- **Don't** turn the default observatory into an isometric game, reward loop,
  or decorative agent aquarium. The optional City 3D view on `simcity` is an
  intentional exception for spatial exploration and validated civic proposals.
  It must keep the 2D atlas available, label derived positions and decorative
  roads, provide HTML inspectors and keyboard controls, respect reduced motion,
  and leave all economic decisions to the authoritative engine. A building
  preview never implies an accepted action or authority over land.

- **Don't** use generic dark-SaaS glass panels, decorative neon glows detached
  from telemetry, or interchangeable metric-card grids.
- **Don't** imply geographic precision when a run exposes no coordinates;
  derived layouts must say so.
- **Don't** use motion or color as the only expression of state.
- **Don't** place rasterized text or controls inside generated imagery.
